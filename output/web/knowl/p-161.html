<div class="para">Does it seem like any racial groups are being disproportionately saddled with student loan debt? How can we compare, say, debt held by white vs. Asian students to see whether the difference is larger than we’d expect? Well, first we need to quantify the idea of "what we’d expect"...what does this mean? Create an <dfn class="terminology">expected frequency table</dfn> for what you’d expect to see if there were absolutely no racial differences in student debt.</div>
