<div class="para">Notice that in making our categories, we’re careful to not let them overlap - we don’t want to accidentally count a value, like 10, that is on the edge in two categories.  We also want to make sure that we don’t have too many different categories.  While you can make a histogram with as many categories as you like, it’s generally best to keep the number of categories small, so that there are a lot of data elements in most of them.  If you use too many categories, then you will be back in the situation where almost every column contains just one or two elements.</div>
