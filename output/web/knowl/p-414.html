<div class="para">Scatterplots are useful because they help us see patterns in the data.  In this graph, we can see that for countries with low emissions and low GDP, an increase in GDP generally corresponds to an increase in CO2 emissions.  This makes sense, because we associate increased economic activity with increased usage of fossil fuels.  We see this especially in the dot for Qatar, located at the extreme right &amp; top of the graph.  However, a number of wealthier nations, including Norway (84,580, 8.21), Singapore (68,402, 6.65), Ireland (64,684, 8.85), Switzerland (61,373, 4.33), and Sweden (45,542, 4.19) don’t fit this trend, having much lower emissions than nations with similar GDPs.  Similarly, there are a number of nations with much higher emissions than countries with similar GDPs - Trinidad &amp; Tobago (28,549, 27.24), Mongolia (13,383, 20.35), Kazakhstan (25,308, 17.45), and Bahrain (39,499, 20.14).  While you can see this from looking at the data table, it is much easier to see these data points that stand out (called <em class="emphasis">outliers</em>) from looking at the scatterplot.</div>
