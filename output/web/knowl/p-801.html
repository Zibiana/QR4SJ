<div class="para">This chapter of <em class="emphasis">Rethinking Mathematics</em> centers around the math-based effort of the author and a group of 5th-grade, Latina students to prevent the closure of their elementary school. The district argued that the school, Agave Elementary, was close enough to the receiving school and labeled "underperforming" on standardized tests, thus it should be closed. The author helped shape the students’ ideas into solvable problems. The girls analyzed test score data over time and found an increase in performance over the past few years. Moreover, the girls investigated the walk to the receiving school, measuring the amount of time it took them to walk based on a given rate. This points to a potential connection with calculus and using derivatives to measure velocity if a similar activity were done for undergraduate students. Having shown that the receiving school was too far a walk by gathering and analyzing data, the district allowed Agave to remain open. The statements of one of the girls suggest that she felt empowered and connected to the math that she used. In general, activities like this that combine math with students’ lives and with politics help support an education that engages students to become active agents for social change.</div>
