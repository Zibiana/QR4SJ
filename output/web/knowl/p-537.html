<div class="para">These bills go against studies showing that transgender children between the age of 5 and 12 viewed their gender identities similarly to cisgender children (Olson, Key, and Eaton 2015), among other academic studies. The leading association of pediatricians in the United States recommends “that youth who identify as [transgender] have access to comprehensive, gender-affirming, and developmentally appropriate health care that is provided in a safe and inclusive clinical space…[and] that pediatricians have a role in advocating for policies and laws that protect youth who identify as [transgender] from discrimination and violence (Rafferty et al. 2018).”</div>
