<div class="para">An example of an anti-trans bill that was struck down after legal action and scrutiny is Tennessee’s SB-0001 from 2023. The legislators who supported the bill sought to restrict minors in Tennessee from accessing gender-affirming care. A word-chart of the bill is shown below. Much of the language that lawmakers used surrounded terms like "minors", "performed", and "medical procedure(s)" in reference to gender-affirming care for trans youth. The term "violation" was used to frame this care in opposition to the laws proposed in the bill.</div>
