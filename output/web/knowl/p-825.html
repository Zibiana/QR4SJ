<div class="para">This paper focuses on a view of learning mathematics through "social participation" (Wenger, 1998) and includes not only thoughts and actions but membership in social communities. Four "faces" of mathematical identity are discussed using selected quotations from students attending a small, rural high school in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. <em class="emphasis">Identity</em> refers to "how we define ourselves and how others define us". The first face of identity is engagement (direct experience of the world and active involvement with others); students made to do repetitive exercises without creating meaning on their own may not see themselves as mathematics learners. The second face is imagination, how students envision mathematics fitting in to their broader lives; teaching mathematics without contextualizing it in students’ personal worlds would lead to students developing an identity as "not a mathematics learner". The third face is alignment, how students align their energies within an institution in response to the imagination phase. The fourth face is nature, but scientific studies have indicated that all students have the capacity to be mathematics learners. The authors recommend that teachers allow students to generate meaning and strategies for solving problems; one starting point is using mathematical tasks that have multiple responses or one response with multiple solutions; hdold their students to high expectations; keeping students informed of institutional requirements for college and careers; and discount the nature face in favor of the others.</div>
