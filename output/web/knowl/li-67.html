<div class="para">The <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-squared value that I asked you to show in 1(f) measures what proportion of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> variable is explained by the trendline. For instance, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=1\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(100\%\)</span> of the variation in <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is explained by the trendline, so the trendline is a perfect fit. Conversely, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=0\)</span> means that the trendline explains <span class="process-math">\(0\%\)</span> of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> variable, so this trendline doesn’t fit the data at all.What percentage of the variation in two-year public college tuition (<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) is explained by the variation in year (<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>)? What about when <span class="process-math">\(y=\)</span> four-year private college tuition? Four-year public college tuition?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="changes-in-college-tuition-over-time.html#li-67" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
