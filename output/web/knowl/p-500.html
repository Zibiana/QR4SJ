<div class="para">You may have heard of the <dfn class="terminology">carbon footprint</dfn>, a particular individual’s contribution to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  The idea of a carbon footprint is that each individual is responsible for their part of the greenhouse gas emission problem, and that they should do their part to help fix it.  The <a class="external" href="https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator" target="_blank">Cool Climate Calculator</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-78-hidden.html" title="Footnote 78"><sup> 78 </sup></a> from the University of California at Berkeley is one such carbon footprint calculator.  The Cool Climate Calculator estimates how much carbon you personally produce, from sources such as driving, electricity, and foods you eat.  It then provides suggestions for how you can reduce you carbon footprint, by doing things like driving less, carpooling, buying more efficient appliances, or becoming a vegetarian.</div>
