<div class="para">In this article, Martin argues that, despite a dearth of "rigorous, explanatory research" on Black children and mathematics, Black children and their competencies tend to be framed in ways that reinforce stereotypes of Black children as "underperforming" and "mathematically illiterate". Martin points out that historical and structural considerations affect the material and cultural circumstances of Black children, and that some policymakers and researchers ignore these forces when describing Black children in the context of "at-risk, poverty-ridden communities, ghettos, dysfunctional families, and oppositional stances toward schooling". Martin argues for a more robust view of the "resilience" of Black children in education, including the ways that Black children overcome "ideologies of Black intellectual inferiority". Resilience among Black students has been categorized by McGee (2009) as <em class="emphasis">fragile</em> or <em class="emphasis">robust</em>, according as students’ motivations were to disprove external racial stereotypes or to develop self-generated motivations and racial identities. Martin argues that scholars in teaching and learning ignore issues such as neoliberal education reform, structural racism, and social policy at their own detriment and to the detriment of Black children who come to be characterized as innately "underachieving", despite having to overcome issues such as poor teacher support, low funding for public education, school closures, lowered expectations, and others. Finally, Martin describes a study that showed how strong early educational experiences, recognition of their abilities by educators, strong support systems, and a strong positive mathematical and academic identity promoted success among Black children.</div>
