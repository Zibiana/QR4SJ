<div class="para">The authors argue for greater integration of mathematics and social studies at the K-12 level in order to emphasize their intersections. The authors define social justice in U.S. education as focused on “striving for educational excellence via the examination of social and historical issues and, therefore, giving voice to the marginalized, and recognizing inequities in order to empower marginalized and privileged students alike so that they can empower those around them to promote diversity and inclusiveness for all persons”. Studies have shown that teachers of social studies and mathematics alike focus very little on sexism and racism. In mathematics, this may stem from the myth of math’s objectivity, as instructors may consider social issues “out of the scope” of their classroom. However, there is still substantial inequality even within schools, as financially under-resourced schools have fewer highly-qualified teachers, and 83% of teachers are White. Many teacher training programs provide limited education about social justice or culturally relevant pedagogy, though researchers have confirmed that culturally relevant teaching practices contributes to educational equity and social justice. Bob Moses, a civil rights activist who started the Algebra Project to provide social justice-based algebra education to low-income students, argues that algebra acts as a gatekeeper to higher levels of mathematics, which disproportionately excludes students of color and poorer students. Although some criticism has held that social justice pedagogy in mathematics is under-theorized, non-rigorous, and requires highly socially conscious teachers to work, others argue that content knowledge becomes more meaningful when it is applied to social issues.</div>
