<div class="para">The author argues that the way mathematics is taught around the world is indicative of a colonial, Eurocentric narrative in which Europe is seen as a “civilizing” force and the significant contributions of mathematicians from non-European backgrounds are downplayed. Through a historical narrative, Joseph shows that such mathematical leaps as written mathematical records, a place value number system, the technique of measurement, our base 10 number system, the “Pythagorean Theorem”, and algebra all originated outside of Europe and were then used by Europeans to advance their own mathematics. Some of the greatest mathematicians of antiquity, such as Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, and Diophantus, developed from the intersections of Greek mathematics with Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics during the Alexandrian Empire. Arab scholars developed a rigorous, advanced geometry and algebra during what in Europe was known as the “Dark Ages”. The marginalization of these contributions contributes to the perception of mathematics as independent of economics, politics, and culture; frames mathematical pursuits as confined to a select few (usually white men); and the enshrining of deductive axiomatic logic (i.e. “formal” mathematical proof) as the “only” method of mathematical discovery. If we as teachers acknowledge the diverse groups which contribute to mathematics and the diversity of ways of doing mathematics, we may be better able to engage students with various backgrounds and mathematical cultures.</div>
