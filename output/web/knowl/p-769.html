<div class="para">Two such models were discussed in the proceedings of the Teaching Undergraduates Mathematics workshop at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (2009): Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory and covariation. APOS theory defines an "action" as a step-by-step transformation of a set of mathematical objects into another mathematical object; for instance, evaluating a composition of functions at the point <em class="emphasis">x</em>. In contrast, the "process stage" of understanding takes place when students "internalize the action into a process" and can then think about the process without performing it. The process stage entails a greater level of abstraction, e.g. finding a general formula for a composition of functions given data for each function in table or graph form. <em class="emphasis">Covariational reasoning</em> is defined as "the cognitive activities involved in coordinating two varying quantities while attending to the ways in which they change in relation to each other"; for instance, attending to parametric equations. Observations of students suggest that covariational processing involves five kinds of mental action; questioning strategies to promote each action in students are suggested (Lai, 2009).</div>
