<div class="para">We briefly describe how each aspect of gender-affirming healthcare is targeted by the categories of bills used in the data analysis in the next sections. Social transition is targeted through <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">youth athletics</code> bills preventing young people from competing on sports teams under their identified gender. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ID requirements</code> prevent the changing of the “sex” listed on birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and other government IDs.<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Public facilities</code> laws prevent all trans people from using restrooms and other gendered public facilities that match their gender identity. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Schools/education</code> laws vary but include laws banning teachers from using students’ correct pronouns at all or without parental permission, discussing queer and trans/nonbinary identities in the classroom, and displaying items such as pride flags supporting queer and trans identities, among others.</div>
