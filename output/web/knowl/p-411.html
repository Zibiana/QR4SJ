<div class="para">Because our data set has these values for 165 countries, we will not include the data table in the text.  The data can be found in <a class="external" href="data-files/co2-emissions-vs-gdp-2018.xlsx" target="_blank">gdp and co2 emissions for all countries in 2018 [Excel Spreadsheet]</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-71-hidden.html" title="Footnote 71"><sup> 71 </sup></a> (data from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-gdp-vs-co2.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.11.1.3">[4.11.1.3]</a>).  We can construct a scatterplot by taking each pair of values and creating a point.  For example, the nation of Qatar has per capita CO2 emissions of 39.27 tons per person, and a GDP of $153,764 per person.  This is because Qatar is a very small nation (Qatar only had 2.7 million people in 2018, when this data was collected) which produces a large amount of oil - oil production is a major source of CO2 emissions and countries with large oil production tend to use more fossil fuels. Qatar would be marked by a dot at x = 39.27, and y = 153,764. Yemen, a country close to Qatar, but much poorer and with much less oil production (and which was fighting a civil war in 2018) has per capita CO2 emissions of only 0.35 tons per person, and a per capita GDP of only $2,285 per person.  The dot for Yemen would be at x=0.35 and y=2,285.</div>
