<div class="para">There are actually several different types of human activity which can cause changes to climate, aside from greenhouse gas emissions.  One example is human-caused changes to the Earth’s <em class="emphasis">albedo</em> - the lightness or darkness of the Earth’s surface.  Lighter colored materials tend to reflect more sunlight, causing a cooling effect, while darker colored materials tend to absorb more sunlight.  Human activity has caused some areas of the Earth’s surface to become darker, like urban areas and areas which were once covered in snow and ice, and thus to absorb more heat.  We have also caused other areas to become lighter, like forests that have been replaced by fields and areas which have become desert, creating a cooling effect (like the moon, deserts tend to be very hot during the day and very cold at night).</div>
