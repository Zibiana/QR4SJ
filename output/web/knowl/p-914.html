<div class="para">There is a dearth of studies that investigate specific teaching practices which benefit underrepresented students, including teacher-student interaction and its effects. Although trying to specify “general” practices across a group as diverse as, for example, African-Americans in the US, may lead to essentialization and/or a deficit framing, a variety of historical conditions in the US have meant that many students of color have been told that they are inferior academically. Therefore, such studies would benefit many groups which are systemically marginalized in US mathematics education, including women and Latin@/e students (Jackson and Wilson, 2012). Further, although there are several collections of “mathematics for social justice” projects, units, and lessons targeted mostly at K-12 educators, Gutstein (2008) claims that no cogent and cohesive curriculum exists and identifies the need for one. Thankfully, Karaali and Khadjavi (2019) have provided a book of resources for postsecondary educators looking to teach math for social justice, and another volume is forthcoming (expected 2021). Further research is needed into the pedagogy and impacts of such an approach, and that such research is deeply essential, since equity-focused mathematics is good for students, underrepresented and otherwise, and good for the society in which we live.</div>
