<div class="para">The <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-squared value that you were asked to show in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/r-squared-nonprofit-status.html" title="Exercise 2.5.3">Exercise 2.5.3</a> above measures what proportion of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-variable is explained by the trendline. For instance, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=1\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(100\%\)</span> of the variation in y is explained by the trendline, so the trendline is a perfect fit. Conversely, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=0\)</span> means that the trendline explains <span class="process-math">\(0\%\)</span> of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> variable, so this trendline doesn’t fit the data at all.What percentage of the variation in two-year public college tuition (<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) is explained by the variation in year (<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>)? What about when <span class="process-math">\(y=\)</span> four-year private college tuition? Four-year public college tuition?</div>
