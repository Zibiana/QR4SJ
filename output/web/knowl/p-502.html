<div class="para">The global pandemic, which shuttered businesses and reduced driving and energy use across the world, reduced carbon emissions into the atmosphere by only 5.4% <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-pandemic.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.11.1.35">[4.11.1.35]</a>.  Experts estimate that we would need to reduce emissions by about 10 times that in order to keep global warming to 2 degrees Centigrade above pre-industrial levels. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-necessary-reduction.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.11.1.36">[4.11.1.36]</a>.  If you think about how your life changed during the pandemic, imagine having to make similarly dramatic changes every year for 10 years to get a sense of how much you would need to change your life to solve this problem - and not only would you need to do it, but you would need to get everyone else to agree to do it too.</div>
