<div class="para">The Sun radiates energy in all directions.  Some of the Sun’s energy is reflected by the atomosphere and the rest reaches the Earth.  In our models, we will assume that the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is fixed.  We will deonte this value by <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  However, in reality, the amount of solar energy reaching Earth is starting to increase. This increase is caused by a decrease in <em class="alert">albedo</em>.  Albedo, denoted <span class="process-math">\(\alpha \text{,}\)</span> is the proportion of solar energy that is reflected by the atmosphere.   Melting ice caps, catalyzed by global warming, are responsible for the decrease in albedo.  While we will not take the changing albedo into account, doing so could make a great extension project.</div>
