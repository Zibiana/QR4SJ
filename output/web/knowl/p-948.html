<div class="para">Malloy begins his chapter by examining a case study in which a Black student is left out of group work because he was “not at the same level as the rest of the students in the class”; this exemplifies how students who are not prepared well by previous coursework could be invisibilized and neglected in future courses. Studies show that Black students learn math best when they are allowed to “focus on the whole, use improvisational intuitive thinking, recall relevant verbal ideas, engage in human and social content material, respond to extrinsic motivation, focus on interests, learn from informal class discussion, achieve interdependently, and narrate human concepts”. Thus, in order to accommodate instruction for all students, teachers must acknowledge student preferences in acquiring knowledge, develop activities that promote student-student and student-teacher interaction, value the knowledge that students bring in to the classroom, create learning opportunities in which students are interdependent, and encourage/provide feedback to students as they learn. This process is encouraged by the culturally relevant/responsive pedagogies of Ladson-Billings and Irvine. The primary aim of Ladson-Billings’ pedagogy is to “assist in the development of a relevant Black personality that allows African American students to choose academic excellence yet still identify with their African and African American culture”. Irvine emphasizes that effective teachers must provide all students with high-level knowledge regardless of previous categorization. Furthermore, using a social justice frame that emphasizes the role of mathematics in democracy and addressing inequality results in student learning and achievement (Gutstein, 2003; Moses &amp; Cobb, 2001). Malloy identifies the concern that most teachers studied did not ask students to use “complex and non-algorithmic” thinking, nor did they work to develop a sociopolitical or critical consciousness in their students.</div>
