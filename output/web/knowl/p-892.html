<div class="para">The author reflects on the educational philosophy of Paulo Freire as it relates to the current state of mathematics education in the US. Freire’s emphasis on basing the content of education on “the present, existential, concrete situation, reflecting the aspirations of the people”. Gutstein identifies Freire’s idea that “political experiences are necessary to develop political consciousness” as the most relevant to his current work. Gutstein argues that the modern emphasis on mathematics education in the US is largely in service of the status quo and “profitability for the financial and corporate elite”. In contrast, Gutstein aims to politicize the mathematics he teaches in a social justice-focused school in Chicago. Although there are several collections of “mathematics for social justice” projects, units, and lessons, Gutstein claims that no cogent and cohesive curriculum exists and identifies the need for one. However, Gutstein identifies one “solution” to this problem as using rich mathematics curricula and including relevant social justice concepts that are co-created with students in response to the curriculum.</div>
