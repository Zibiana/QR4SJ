<div class="para">This decreases the number of bills in our dataset from 927 to 893. Next, note that the bills whose status is labeled <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Introduced*</code> by TTL are those that failed to meet their state’s “crossover deadline”, the date by which a bill must pass out of the chamber in which it was introduced and to the other chamber (e.g. State House vs. Senate). According to the site <a class="external" href="https://www.tracktranslegislation.com/" target="_blank">Track Trans Legislation</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-108-hidden.html" title="Footnote 108"><sup> 108 </sup></a>, a bill that is not passed in its initial chamber by the crossover deadline “faces high procedural hurdles in order to move forward.” Thus, we wish to classify these bills (at least for the current session) as “Dead/Failed”.</div>
