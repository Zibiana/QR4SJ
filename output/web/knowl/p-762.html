<div class="para">This paper describes a case study of a motivated, mathematically knowledgeable tenth-grade teacher at a public school in Johannesburg, South Africa, made up entirely of Black students; learners are often assaulted on their way to and from school. Since recent research has shown that mathematics education reform has mitigated achievement gaps between marginalized and other learners. The learners’ mathematical knowledge was two years below grade level; this led to a lot of basic errors, defined as errors not expected at the grade level. The moves used by the teacher were recorded and divided into five categories. In the first week of study, the instructor frequently used the elicit move to get a desired response from a learner, while in the second week, the instructor worked to develop mathematical reasoning in dialogue with his students, increasing his use of the press move to ask learners to explain more of their reasoning or push for something more from them. Previous research has indicated that a first-level teaching move to engage more with students often involves increasing pressing; perhaps this would be a good, low-overhead way to bring more learner-centered instruction into public schools.</div>
