<div class="para">There are many reasons that an equity framework is useful for teaching mathematics. There is still substantial inequality within schools, as financially under-resourced schools have fewer highly-qualified teachers, and 83% of teachers are White. Many teacher training programs provide limited education about social justice or culturally relevant pedagogy, though researchers have confirmed that culturally relevant teaching practices contribute to educational equity (McGee 2014). Preservice teachers often view student diversity as a problem rather than a resource, and many teachers hold a view that “all students should be treated equally in the classroom”, even when this leads to disproportionately negative outcomes for students of color (Rousseau &amp; Tate, 2003). This “one-size-fits-all” mentality is a common, serious obstacle to true teacher reflection and equity. Further, the “color-blind” mentality, in which a teacher claims “not to see color”, leads to ignoring students’ cultural backgrounds in the classroom, thus leading to decreased student engagement, as well as a refusal to combat historical and actual racist practices (Rousseau &amp; Tate, 2003). In classroom observations, Rousseau &amp; Tate (2003) report several instances of students being “allowed to fail” through their teacher’s neglect; such students were disproportionately Black, specifically Black men.</div>
