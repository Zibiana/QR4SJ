<div class="para">While human beings are unlikely to go extinct - our intelligence has made us more adaptable than other species - climate change has already begun to affect our species.  Research has shown that production of the 10 largest crops in the world has already dropped by 1% since 1974 below where it would be without the impact of climate change <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-crops.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.11.1.20">[4.11.1.20]</a>.  The United Nations High Commission on Refugees estimates that between 2008 and 2019, there were over 21.5 million displacements of people - when an individual was forced to flee their home - caused by weather-related events, more than twice as many as those caused by conflicts or violence <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-refugees.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.11.1.21">[4.11.1.21]</a>.   The same data shows that climate disasters like droughts, cyclones, and floods can have destabilizing effects on countries, especially those already experiencing conflict, like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Mozambique.</div>
