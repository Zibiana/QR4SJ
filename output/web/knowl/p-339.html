<div class="para">This unprecedented rapid change to greenhouse gas levels has caused a corresponding rapid increase in global temperatures.  While the Earth’s biosphere (a collective term for all life on the planet, including plants, animals, and all other organisms, and the environments that support that life) has survived changes of similar magnitude in the past, those changes have been much slower.  The natural processes of evolution which allow life to adapt to climate changes tend to happen slowly, over many generations.  So, while some species with very short life-cycles (like bacteria, or even insects) may be able to adapt to the changes through evolution, longer-lived species will only be able to survive by moving to another area.  Scientists estimate that 95% of species will experience local extinction (meaning either extinction or departure from that area) after a <span class="process-math">\(2.86^\circ\)</span>C risee in temperatures, and that 16-30% of species could go extinct by 2070 <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-extinction.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.11.1.40">[4.11.1.40]</a>.</div>
