<div class="para">This chapter of the workshop proceedings begins by quoting Marilyn Carlson that the debate between “teacher-directed instruction” and “student-centered discovery” is “distract[ing] the community with false dichotomies and vague premises”, a polarizing position that may inadvertently discount quality scholarship. The authors continue by presenting two characterizations of student understanding of mathematical functions: Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory and covariation. APOS theory defines an “action” as a step-by-step transformation of a set of mathematical objects into another mathematical object; for instance, evaluating a composition of functions at the point x. In contrast, the “process stage” of understanding takes place when students “internalize the action into a process” and can then think about the process without performing it. The process stage entails a greater level of abstraction, e.g. finding a general formula for a composition of functions given data for each function in table or graph form. <em class="emphasis">Covariational reasoning</em> is defined as “the cognitive activities involved in coordinating two varying quantities while attending to the ways in which they change in relation to each other”; for instance, attending to parametric equations. Observations of students suggest that covariational processing involves five kinds of mental action; questioning strategies to promote each action in students are suggested. Finally, the authors discuss the balance of <em class="emphasis">social scaffolding</em> to keep a discussion moving and <em class="emphasis">analytic scaffolding</em> to keep a discussion mathematically productive and suggest requirements for an instructor to use analytic scaffolding successfully.</div>
