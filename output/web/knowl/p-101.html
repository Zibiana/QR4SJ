<li><div class="para">Create a graph, trendline, and interpret the <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}\)</span> value for each type of institution: public nonprofit, private nonprofit, private for-profit. What does it mean?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Use it to predict average tuition and fees across the country in the current year. How accurate is your prediction?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What trends over time do you notice in each the three graphs? Describe trends in words, using phrases like “increasing”, “decreasing”, “increasing slope”, “decreasing slope”. What overall trend do we notice that’s common to all three graphs over time?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-squared value that I asked you to show in 1(f) measures what proportion of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> variable is explained by the trendline. For instance, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=1\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(100\%\)</span> of the variation in <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is explained by the trendline, so the trendline is a perfect fit. Conversely, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=0\)</span> means that the trendline explains <span class="process-math">\(0\%\)</span> of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> variable, so this trendline doesn’t fit the data at all.What percentage of the variation in two-year public college tuition (<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) is explained by the variation in year (<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>)? What about when <span class="process-math">\(y=\)</span> four-year private college tuition? Four-year public college tuition?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">“Outliers” <dfn class="terminology"></dfn> are data that fall far away from the trendline. What outliers do you notice, if any? Interpret these outliers in context: what do they mean for tuition and fees over time, and what possible historical explanations could there be for these outliers?</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">“Polynomials” <dfn class="terminology"></dfn> are a special type of mathematical function, or process for turning one number into another. Polynomials are functions of the form</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">sums of powers of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> maybe with constant terms in front. For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=17x^{3}-234x+7\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=-x^{142}+1\)</span> are all polynomials. The polynomial <span class="process-math">\(a(x)=x^{2}+2x+3\)</span> takes the input <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and turns it into the output <span class="process-math">\(1^{2}+2(1)+3=6\text{.}\)</span> All numbers which make sense to input are called the <em class="emphasis">domain</em> of the function, and the possible sensical outputs you could get are called the <em class="emphasis">range.</em>What is the domain and range of each of the polynomial trendlines?</div>
