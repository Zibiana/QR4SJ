<div class="para">The question of responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions has emerged as a major one in recent years. The Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty, and the Paris Climate Accords, in 2016, sought to set targets for individual nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  These treaties approached climate change from the perspective of shared responsibility, in a historical sense.  Figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-figure-cumulative-co2-emissions-region.html" title="Figure 4.8.1">Figure 4.8.1</a> shows how this responsibility for global emissions has changed over time in a <em class="emphasis">stacked 100% line graph</em>.  A stacked 100% line graph is like a pie chart stretched out over time - each vertical "slice" of the graph represents the percentage that that region contributed to global greenhouse gas emissions in that year.  You can see in the graph that at the beginning (1750), Europe contributed 100% of the recorded emissions of CO2.  As time goes on, other regions, like the USA, began to contribute more, and in the 20th century emissions from other parts of the world, like China, India, and the remainder of North America, began to grow.</div>
