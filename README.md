## Welcome

Welcome to the workbook's GitHub page! This is a work in progress; I aim to write and collate open-source lesson plans for TMSJ (teaching math for social justice) into a workbook you can use in your courses. I am indebted to and model my work after the K-12 educators (e.g. [Bob Moses](https://rethinkingschools.org/articles/radical-equations/), [Jonathan Osler](https://radicalmath.org/)) who have been doing this work for decades.

The book itself is currently hosted [on GitHub Pages](https://qr-for-social-justice.github.io/workbook/). Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out (email Kenan's first initial, followed by their last name, at westminsteru dot edu) if you have comments, questions, or suggestions!

## Compilation instructions
If your goal is to use the book as-is in a course or seminar, you can simply share the [book's website](https://bit.ly/QR4SJ) with your students; [bit.ly/QR4SJ](https://bit.ly/QR4SJ) can be used as a memorable link. 

If you're interested in modifying, remixing, or compiling the book for yourself (and you're encouraged to!), this text is written in [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) (previously called MathBook XML), so the primary source files can be found in the `/source` directory. These can be compiled into HTML or LaTeX files (as well as some other formats) using the recommended [PreTeXt GitHub Codespace](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/tutorial-github.html). If you do not want to bother with this step or just want to grab some LaTeX to use in a worksheet or the like, the generated LaTeX is already provided in the latex folder.

## Contributing
Any and all suggestions to improve the text are welcome. Thanks to those who have already pointed out typos/issues they have found. If you would like to make a more substantial contribution, please contact me so we can discuss how best to proceed.
