    "# Shift Ciphers in Sage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first Sage module for the course! Sage is a bunch of math-centric enhancements to the Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean you're expected to learn how to program in this course? Not at all! While you're welcome to play around and try to extend your code if you have prior programming experience (come talk to me about your plans if this is the case), most of what you'll be doing involves \"thoughtful copy-pasting\" of existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is \"thoughtful copy/paste\"? When coding is new to people, it's almost impossible to type a line of code that will run without error. Why not find some code that you know will execute and modify it slightly? It's in that modification that one needs to be thoughtful. What do you need to change and why? The goal for this course is that you'll come out with a little more knowledge of how to tweak a single bit of code to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this sound like cheating? It isn't a cop-out. It's helping everyone get to the point where Sage makes sense and will give results. In fact, you have some programming background and are interested in doing more with R, there are countless online resources you can visit to augment your learning. (The rest of the free Codecademy Python course is a good start.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's the point?\n",
    "\n",
    "So why are we using programming in a cryptography course? Frankly, because no one does cryptography anymore with pen and paper. While this may have been possible in Julius Caesar's time, nowadays cryptography is conducted almost exclusively on computers, by computer programs. In fact, by the end of this course, we'll be doing cryptography this is *literally impossible* to do by hand. This type of cryptography (RSA encryption) keeps credit card info safe online and is one of the most commonly used computer programs today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even for older encryption systems like shift ciphers, it's still an enormous time-saver to use a computer to encrypt our messages. My goal in this course is to give you more time to focus on concepts than on the arithmetic and simple computations you need to encrypt shift ciphers. Once you understand the basics of how a cipher works, shifting repetitive tasks to a computer helps you focus on the broader concepts underlying each type of encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "Sage is *case-sensitive*. This means that typing `SAGE` is different from typing `Sage`, which is different from typing `sage`. This can lead to some confusion when, for instance, you define a function called `ShiftEncrypt` and want to run it, but you accidentally type `shiftencrypt` instead. In that case, **copy/pasting existing code is the best method**. Don't try to write your own code unless you absolutely have to, because that increases the likelihood that you'll make a typing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, our goal is to play around with a small program that will encrypt text using a shift cipher. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to be able to input any plaintext we want and the desired shift. The program should then spit out the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll do an example, encoding the message \"MYSECRET\" using a shift of 3, like the classical Caesar cipher. You'll then use this example to define a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reach each of the following chunks of code (detectable by their gray backgrounds), click \"Run\" in the toolbar above."

    "Just like a mathematical function like $f(x)=3x+2$, Sage functions have *inputs* or *independent variables* (like $x$ in the example $f(x)=3x+2$) and *outputs* or *dependent variables* (like the $3x+2$). For every input $x$ (for example $x=3$), the function outputs $3$ times that input plus $2$. So for the input $3$, the function $f(x)$ spits out $11$.\n",

    "Remember from Codecademy that, to start defining a Sage or Python function, you have to start with a `def` command. I'll set the `def` command up for you below; try copy-pasting your code from the chunk above underneath the `def` command. Remember that everything the function does has to be tabbed over once, and everything in your `for` loop has to be tabbed over once more, so the stuff inside your `for` loop is *double*-tabbed! I\"ll start you off by defining the alphabet and the empty string called `ciphertext` like we did above."
