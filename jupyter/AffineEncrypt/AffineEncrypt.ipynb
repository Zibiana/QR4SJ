    "The affine cipher is more complicated than the shift cipher. This is good for encryption security, but makes the cipher even more cumbersome to implement by hand. In this Python module, you'll write a function that takes as inputs a plaintext message $P$, multiplicative key $m$, and additive key $k$, and outputs the ciphertext $C$ via the equation $C\\equiv mP+k\\mod{26}$. Then, you'll encrypt several messages with this function. Finally, you'll develop a new function that allows you to use a larger alphabet to affine-encipher messages, for example by adding characters such as !, ?, and *.\n",

    "Let's begin by outlining the code necessary to encrypt a message using the affine cipher. Luckily, it only takes a small modification of your `ShiftEncrypt` code to encrypt using an affine cipher. Instead of adding $k$, our shift, and then reducing $\\mod 26$, we're first multiplying by $m$, adding $k$, and reducing the result $\\mod 26$.\n",
