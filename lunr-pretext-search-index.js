  "body": " Getting Started   If you're new to incorporating social justice issues into math classes, I'd encourage you to start by reading or skimming Jonathan Osler's \"A Guide for Integrating Issues of Social and Economic Justice into Mathematics Curriculum\" , made by a high-school educator but equally relevant in the postsecondary context. Next, Drew Winter's \"Infusing Mathematics with Culture\" offers a valuable framework for thinking about the relationship between mathematical content and social justice issues, as well as an emphasis on connecting to student activism and interests.  This book is meant to be used as a workbook for students in a quantitative reasoning (QR) course framed around issues of social justice (SJ). This course developed out of my resource folder for open-access SJ math resources ; feel free to mix and match chapters from this book and resources from the folder to plug into existing courses as well as to \"remix\" your own full course.    Why Teach Postsecondary Math for Social Justice?    Culturally relevant teaching practices contribute to educational equity and social justice (McGee 2014)  Teaching math with a social justice frame increases student learning and achievement (Gutstein 2003; Moses & Cobb 2001; Winter 2007)  Math is already political. What assumptions do our algorithms and databases inherit (O'Neill 2016)? What do we think is \"worthy\" of mathematical inquiry? Math with applications to petroleum engineering or fracking (Hendrickson 2015) ? Statistical analyses of police stops by race (Khadjavi 2013 , Ince 2021 )?  See this literature review (Ince 2015) for an investigation of what the research shows about teaching math for social justice.

  "title": "Example SJ Math Activities for the First Day",
  "body": " Example SJ Math Activities for the First Day   Introductory Questions  Here are some examples of questions I've asked my students, almost always in a think-pair-share format, to start off a semester-long course on quantitative reasoning for social justice.   Defining social justice  What do you think of when you think of social justice? What are 2-3 issues of SJ you're passionate about? Can we develop a working definition of SJ as a class?   Some possible answers:  justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society. (Google Dictionary)  a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society. (Wikipedia)  a state or doctrine of egalitarianism (Merriam-Webster)  A broad term for action intended to create genuine equality, fairness and respect among peoples. (University of Massachusetts Lowell Department of Multicultural Affairs)    One working definition that my classes have used (due to Sensoy-DiAngelo) is the following. Social justice is a recognition that:  all people are individuals, but we are also members of socially constructed groups;  society is stratified, and social groups are valued unequally;  social groups that are valued more highly have greater access to resources and this access is structured into the institutions and cultural norms;  social injustice is real and exists today;  relations of unequal power are constantly being enacted at both the micro (individual) and macro (structural) levels;  we are all socialized to be complicit in these relations;  those who claim to be for social justice must strategically act from that claim in ways that challenge social injustice; and  this action requires a commitment to an ongoing and lifelong process.      Here are some more examples I've used in courses during the pandemic:   A first-day activity for a pandemic  Consider the following questions  What are some social justice issues that are important to you in the midst of rising inequality and authoritarianism, climate crisis, racial justice movements, and more?  What are some ways we could measure each of these issues? (how bad they are, solutions, societal reactions, etc.)  What are some things you don't know how to measure about each of these issues?  Estimate: what are some strategies for measuring these things? Don't try to plug in numbers yet, just make a list.  What are some ways to, as accurately as possible, measure how severe the COVID-19 outbreak is in your city? Write down any assumptions you make about what \"severe\" means.  If you were a disability rights activist concerned about the dangers of COVID-19 for immunocompromised folks, which of these ways would you choose to measure? Estimate or find the info.  If you were an administrator at your college or university, which of these ways would you choose to measure? Explain, then estimate or find the info.  What are some things it would be ideal to be able to measure in order to curtail or prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your city? Do the same as above: how would you measure these things as a disability rights activist? As a college administrator?  Brainstorm some ways to obtain the measurements you described above. If you obtained these measurements, how could you use them to advocate for positive change?  What questions about social justice, health\/accessibility, and math does this activity bring up for you?   You may have come up with questions similar to the following:  How did we measure X?  What's the best way to measure X?  What values are inherent in the way we measure X?  If your goal is to advocate for social justice, how does that change the \"best\" way of measuring X?    We just demonstrated a couple of tools we'll use many times in the next week or two:  Estimation : round up or down to make calculations easier and numbers less messy. As we saw when estimating the number of classrooms needed for the US household wealth, rounding before the computation ends can introduce error. Therefore, if you have a calculator, it's best to plug into the calculator before rounding, whereas if you're computing by hand, rounding may be necessary in order to increase the accuracy of your computations. Everyone makes arithmetic mistakes–you'll see me do it plenty of times!  Dimensional analysis : start with the given and multiply by fractions, canceling out the units, until you get something in the units your answer should be in. This is almost always your answer!       Setting the stage This activity is almost directly adapted from Dana Ernst's \"Setting the Stage\" inquiry-based learning activity. Get in groups of size 3–4. Group members should introduce themselves - name, pronouns, hobbies outside school, goals for the semester\/year, reason they're taking the course. For each of the questions that follow, I will ask you to:  Think about a possible answer on your own.  Discuss your answers with the rest of your group.  Share a summary of each group's discussion.  The questions are as follows:  What are the goals of a college or university education? How does social justice fit in? How does math?  How does a person learn something new?  What is the value of making mistakes in the learning process?  How do we create a safe environment where risk taking is encouraged and productive failure is valued?    As Ernst describes on his website , Each time I've run the activity, the responses are slightly different. The responses to the first two questions are usually what you would expect. Question 3 always generates great discussions. The idea of \"productive failure\" naturally arises when discussing question 4 and I provide them with this language sometime while discussing this question. Listening to the students' responses to question 4 is awesome. It's really nice to get the students establishing the necessary culture of the class without me having to tell them what to do.  After we are done discussing the 5 questions, I elaborate on the importance of productive failure and inform that I will often tag things in class with the hashtag #pf in an attempt to emphasize its value. I also provide them with the following quote from Mike Starbird: \"Any creative endeavor is built on the ash heap of failure.\" I wrap up the activity by conveying some claims I make about education and stating some of my goals as a teacher.  Claims   An education must prepare a student to ask and explore questions in contexts that do not yet exist. That is, we need individuals capable of tackling problems they have never encountered and to ask questions no one has yet thought of.  If we really want students to be independent, inquisitive, & persistent, then we need to provide them with the means to acquire these skills.         Group work and class norms  There is some evidence that the use of group roles, in which all group members rotate assigned tasks each day, improves student learning See e.g. Hauk, S., Speer, N. M., Kung, D., Tsay, J.-J., and Hsu, E. (Eds.) (2013). Video cases for college mathematics instructor professional development, currently accessible (as of 3-29-2022) at this link . Additionally, in a course that discusses sensitive political topics, my experience has emphasized the importance of agreeing on discussion norms before beginning a sensitive discussion. I hope the following activities help with establishing both of these sets of norms.   Ground rules  Given the nature of this course, it's important that we develop class norms to promote an atmosphere which will facilitate the learning process as well as respect the experiences of different groups in the classroom and the larger society. The class can agree to revise them and add others, but all students must commit themselves to the final set of rules by the end of the first class. These principles will guide our class discussions and interactions.  Setting group norms  Think-Pair-Share on what common norms for group work and discussion are important for our class.    Whose voices are valued?    What philosophy do we have about who can make contributions to mathematics and the value of those contributions?    How does this connect to the values we espouse for our democracy?       Here are some useful classroom norms:     Controversy and vulnerability : different views are expected and honored with a group commitment to understand the sources of disagreement and to work cooperatively toward common solutions without putting a disproportionate responsibility on marginalized groups to educate us .    No one's identities are under question: e.g. no arguing that queer people are wrong for existing.    Please come talk to your instructor anytime you feel uncomfortable enough that it's affecting your work in class.       Own your intentions and your impact. Acknowledge that the impact of your actions is not always congruent with your intentions and that positive or neutral intentions do not trump negative impact. Participate truthfully and accept when your actions or words harm others.     Challenge by choice : individuals may determine for themselves if and to what degree they will participate in a given discussion or activity. It is possible not to participate in a few activities and still receive an A in the course. Be aware of what factors influence your decision about whether to challenge yourself on a given issue.     Respect : each other and yourselves. Investigate how your cultural context affects what you think of as respect for others and acknowledge what respect looks like in other contexts.     No attacks . personal attacks are a form of extreme disrespect. Disagreeing with ideas is welcome; attacking individuals for their ideas is not.         (TPS) What does respect look like for you? How might ideas of respect vary with cultural context? How might you firmly challenge the views of someone else in a respectful manner?   What are the differences betweeen a personal attack and a challenge to an idea that makes an individual feel uncomfortable? What are some situations that might blur the lines between the two? How can we acknowledge when certain beliefs (e.g. trans people not existing) are inherently personal attacks?      Group roles   Group roles : In order to facilitate group interaction, you will take on group roles designed to mimic the role of mathematical and\/or sociological researchers. The roles are as follows:     The facilitator is responsible for making sure every student is able to contribute and be heard. Contributions may include asking good questions, rephrasing someone else's idea, coming up with a way of connecting mathematics to the real world, and many others.    the resource manager is responsible for obtaining and keeping track of all necessary resources to solve a problem. Resources may include writing utensils, paper, the Internet, your instructor, data sources, and most importantly, your team.    the lead author is responsible for writing down the ideas that each group comes up with.    the communicator is responsible for reporting what your group came up with to the class, instructor, and any relevant community groups.    Assign roles to each group by first letters of first name; they'll rotate every day of class. Anyone can answer questions posed to the whole class, but if your group came up with an idea that hasn't been shared yet, it someone in your group's responsibility to share your answer so that everyone can learn from you!

  "body": " Cui Bono: Who Benefits?     Hasan Minhaj on Student Loans  The comedian Hasan Minhaj, of the former Netflix weekly show Patriot Act, focused a popular episode of his show on student loans in the US. Amazingly, this led to an invitation to testify before Congress on September 10, 2019, on the student loan debt crisis. Please watch the above YouTube clip from Patriot Act (good closed captioning available on YouTube), then answer the following questions.   What are some of the consequences that are faced by people who can't pay off their student loans?    What happened in 2010 to change the landscape of student loan debt in the US?    What are loan servicers, and what has their role been in the student loan crisis?  >  What are three ways in which Navient has mistreated borrowers?    What is an income-based repayment plan? What is forbearance, and why has it negatively affected borrowers when Navient encourages borrowers to enter forbearance instead of income-based repayment?    In what ways does Minhaj argue that the Department of Education has failed borrowers?      The highest proportion of student loan debt (the amount of debt held per student) is held by students at for-profit colleges , which are colleges that are not funded by taxes but instead depend on federal student aid (guaranteed by the government) and the tuition dollars that students pay to attend, often backed up by federal student aid. Contrast this situation with the vast majority of colleges and universities in the U.S., which are nonprofit institutions, which are usually run by a not-for-profit institution, religious organization, or government and hence often receive funding from taxes or a particular religious group.  The greatest proportion of defaults (see ) on student debt in  occurred at the University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University , of which all but Nova are for-profit.  Almost all students are eligible to receive federal student loans, which are student loans funded by the U.S. federal government through programs such as Pell Grants. Federal loans are either subsidized (that is, interest payments are covered by the federal government for a period including the student's time at a college or university ; such loans are restricted to undergraduates only) or unsubsidized (in which case borrowers must pay the interest).  In contrast, private student loans are loans offered by non-governmental companies which are heavily advertised, do not offer the relatively generous forbearance and deferred-payment options that federal loans do, and charge interest while the borrower is in college. Often, private student loan interest rates are higher even than those of unsubsidized federal student loans. Since many students do not have a credit history, federal student loans do not require proof of, or a co-signer attesting, creditworthiness , or evidence of past ability to repay debt; as of the s, most private student loans required such proof . Additionally, students who declare bankruptcy are unable to discharge private student loans, meaning borrowers who have no money are still required to pay private corporations back for student loans . Therefore, the U.S. government earns more income from student loans, but profits less, on average, than private student loan companies.  Employers benefit from the number of students who attend college, including those who could not otherwise attend without taking out student loans. Credentialism , the continuing growth in employers' expectations of postsecondary education on the part of their employees, has been called a key driver of student loan debt . In , earnings were stagnant for most workers, but declined rapidly for workers with no college education. This pressures people to seek a college education whether or not they can afford it.  Finally, a article in The Atlantic implies that middle-class college graduates were able to advance their cause over other causes championed by more marginalized groups because they have higher relative political power compared to non-college graduates. Certainly, as we will see in the next sections, middle-class college graduates benefit a great deal from President Biden's student debt cancellation policy.  "

  "body": " Big Problem: the Staggering and Inequitable Burden of U.S. Student Debt      Student loans are a form of debt taken on in order to help students afford to pay tuition, fees, and other expenses necessary to attend colleges and universities. Unlike scholarships or grants, student loans must be repaid.    In July , student loan debt in the U.S. totaled trillion. In , the average debt held by a student loan borrower was .      Defaulting on a loan means a borrower stops making the required payments on that loan. When someone defaults on a student loan, the federal government is allowed to withhold their tax refund, paycheck, or (for older adults) Social Security payments.     The average person to default on their student loans owes less than , suggesting that defaulters are make significantly lower incomes than the average student loan borrower. Those borrowers who did not complete a college degree are three times as likely to default as those who completed . Moreover, half of Black borrowers who took out loans in - had defaulted after years.     The Pell Grant is a federal government grant which provides money for college to low-income students that does not have to be repaid, unlike student loans.     Those who receive a Pell Grant, signaling they are low-income without adding to their debt, are still disproportionately likely to default on their student loans .     All public and most private colleges ( of all colleges in  are not-for-profit institutions , meaning they invest their profits back into the institution and often operate under independent governance. A college that is not registered as a not-for-profit institution is called a for-profit college .       A college or university operates under independent governance if their leadership is required to focus on factors other than generating a profit when providing an education .     A government study in found that the default rates for student borrowers at for-profit institutions, which are not required to focus on factors other than profit, were nearly double compared to community colleges; for-profit institutions have more expensive tuition and fees than community colleges, have lower graduation rates, and have less valuable credentials .      Tuition is the amount of money charged by a college for instruction by faculty.    A student fee is a sum of money charged to students at a school, college, or university in addition to tuition. Student fees may be used to support student organizations and activities, sports teams, exercise facilities, class supplies such as art materials, or anything else beyond the cost of instruction.     The United States is a relative outlier compared to other nations in the high cost of college tuition and fees. For example, according to a late study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. has the highest average tuition costs of the OECD member countries . This tuition has increased over time.  "

  "body": " The Intersectional Inequities of Student Debt   The average undergraduate student who takes out student loans has around in debt by the end of their higher education, according to the U.S. Department of Education. However, this debt is not spread equitably by demographic category: of non-Hispanic-identifying Black families carry an education loan, compared to of non-Hispanic white families and of Hispanic-identifying families .  Student debt is also not equally spread among age groups; Millennials (who were - years old in ) total over billion in student loan debt, compared to a little over million of Gen Z (under in ), a little under million held by those - years of age in , a bit under million held by those - years old, and only around million held by those or older in  .  Since Black families have been prevented from amassing generational wealth through systemic racism (in which laws favor one racial group over another), the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and mass incarceration, as well as continued implicit and explicit racism in public policy, housing (including the legacy of redlining, a policy which conitnued through ), private banking and lending, access to education, and hiring practices, Black folks are both more likely to have to take on debt to attend college and less likely to attain wealth due to a college education .  In particular, a study found that the average white college-educated parent contributed to their children's education, while Black parents contributed on average. This is true despite the fact that, when controlling by household type and economic situation, Black parents contribute more on average than white parents.  Lower-income Black parents are disproportionately likely to take out Parent PLUS loans, which are loans provided by the U.S. Department of Education to the parents of college students. Parent PLUS loans are unsubsidized and charge a loan fee (added to each loan payment) of and an interest rate of as of  , adding a substantial financial burden to the parent borrower.  Under these circumstances, Black borrowers default on student loans five times more often that white borrowers . Therefore, the disproportionate load of student debt on Black borrowers is both a symptom of, and exacerbates, the racial wealth gap in the U.S., or the difference in total assets and debts between Black and white Americans.  Defaulting on federal student loan debt leads to consequences such as bad credit ratings, a decrease in tax refunds, the garnishment of wages, and removal of security clearances which are at times a condition of employment . The consequences for those who default include an inability to obtain loans to buy homes or cars, loss of wages, or loss of employment.   The Toll of Student Debt in the U.S.   The data in this section come partly from a New York Times article by Ella Koeze and Karl Russell entitled The Toll of Student Debt in the U.S. An archived version of the article can be accessed here .   What are three things you notice about the graphs shown in the article? Explain what these particular things mean for students with debt.    What are three things you wonder about based on the article that are not answered in the article itself?    Do some research online and find reputable sources to answer your questions above.       Trends in Student Aid   The following four questions are about the most recent College Board Trends in Student Aid  publication, which can be downloaded here .    Explain the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. (You may have to use other online sources.)    When did the federal government begin giving unsubsidized loans to students according to the chart in Trends in Student Aid ? (You may also have to use other online sources.)    Since the year , describe the trend for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans.     The Biden-Harris Loan Forgiveness Plans   In and , the Biden-Harris administration released a plan whose multiple components are designed to decrease the burden of student loan debt on lower-income individuals. Read the White House's announcement of the plan , then answer the following questions.    In your own words, describe the three main components of the White House's student debt relief plan . Who is impacted by each part? What impacts would the plan have on each group?    Which do you feel is the most essential component of the plan? Why?    What is the current status of this debt relief plan? You may have to do additional research online. Has it been blocked by the courts? Changed by legislation? Implemented in full? Why or why not?   >    The Atlantic asks, \" Who Really Benefits From Student-Loan Forgiveness ?\"   The article hints that student loan debt has received national attention because college graduates have significant political power. Do you believe that student debt forgiveness is a privileged position to advocate for? Why or why not?    Why might student debt exacerbate the racial wealth gap? Do you think it does?    Do you believe that canceling student debt helps shrink the racial wealth gap? Why or why not?    How could you use statistics to determine whether student loan debt was due to rising tuition\/fees, inflation, or as the article mentions, the number of recipients attending grad school? What do you believe?        According to a late 2017 study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , the U.S. has the greatest annual average tuition and fees of all surveyed countries charged to nationals of that country. Note that the symbols a in the table mean the category does not pply , while m means data are not available ( missing ).    What general trends (by continent, region, degree type, or type of institution) do you notice in the table? Explain.    What impact may the missing or not applicable data have on the general trends observed in the table? Explain.       Reading the News on Student Loans   Part of quantitative literacy is being able to critically interpret numbers and mathematics in the news media. To that end, find an article from the last four years involving student loans that makes at least 2-3 numerical claims. The College Board website or reputable news sources ( New York Times , Washington Post , Reuters, Associated Press, etc.) about government policy on student loans and loan forgiveness are good sources,; you're welcome to find your own sources as well. Take the number(s) in your article and do the following:    Decide what point the article is trying to make by citing these numbers.    Before pulling out an electronic device, brainstorm a list of questions (3-5) you'd like to know about the numbers–things that would help you understand if the numbers are big or small, and whether or not the underlying data actually supports the article's argument.    Get online and try to answer your questions.    Rate the article's claims on two scales:    How true is the statement? (0 = completely false, 4 = completely true)    How misleading is the statement? (0 = not at all, 4 = totally misleading) (In other words, when you look at the underlying data, does it support the article's point or not?)       Student Debt by Race: What Is Fair?    Compare the total amount paid in student debt for various racial groups using this table .    Does it seem like any racial groups are being disproportionately saddled with student loan debt? How can we compare, say, debt held by white vs. Asian students to see whether the difference is larger than we'd expect? Well, first we need to quantify the idea of \"what we'd expect\"...what does this mean? Create an expected frequency table for what you'd expect to see if there were absolutely no racial differences in student debt.    Compute the difference between the observed count for each race and the expected count . What do you notice?    What if we averaged all the 's for each racial group? This is effectively the idea of a chi-squared test for goodness-of-fit , which is used by statisticians to determine whether any differences observed are small enough to be due to chance or large enough that they give evidence of a difference. What would the equation for this average look like?    We'll use a computer to perform this test in a minute. First, what groups do you think are disproportionately likely\/unlikely to hold student loan debt? What racial groups have a higher\/lower debt burden per person?    Now, enter this data into an app such as RStudio or an online tool. In RStudio, run this code to do a chi-squared test. (In a statistics class, walk through the steps.) Output the -value (the likelihood the observed differences are due to chance alone) and residuals , which are basically scaled versions of the s for each racial group. Which are highest? Lowest? Is there evidence of racial bias?     If these materials are being used for a course in, say, introductory statistics for STEM fields or a higher-level data science class, this is a good time to discuss linear regression with multiple predictors to formalize the effect of year and type of institution on tuition or race and year on student debt. However, since this text is primarily intended for courses without prerequisites targeted at majors and non-majors alike, such material is beyond the scope of this chapter.  "

  "body": " Solving for Change: Student Loan Reform & Activism in the U.S.  In August , President Biden committed to forgiving in student debt for around million debtors in the U.S., with an additional being forgiven for Pell Grant recipients. The debt was forgiven only for single adults earning under a year and married couples earning under a year .  Student debt in the U.S. in , when President Biden proposed his student loan debt forgiveness plan, was roughly equal to the size of the economy of Brazil . Additionally, the amount of funding for higher education provided by state governments has declined from around in the s to slightly under in .  An independent analysis by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business found that about two-thirds of the financial benefit from Biden's student loan forgiveness plan will be to households making or less per year, especially households earning between and a year . The impact to the U.S. budget will be between and billion.  The Wharton School also released the data in on the distribution of student loan forgiveness benefits by income under the Biden student loan forgiveness plan. Most of the debt forgiven would have accumulated for those in the - age group; hence, this column may be more representative of the plan's effects. No benefit is expected to go to the top of earners in either age group. Data from Wharton School of Business.   Student Debt Forgiven under the Biden-Harris Plan     All Ages  Age -    Income Group  Percentage of benefit  Percentage of benefit    Bottom      st- th percentile      st- th percentile      st- th percentile      -      -        Student Loan Activism & Policy  For each of the following questions, read the cited article, considering the listed questions. Then use what you've read, as well as your own thoughts, to make your best attempt at answering these questions. Finally, bring these attempts to class and discuss them with your group. Choose someone in your group to report your group's conclusions during full-class discussion.      This article by Mother Jones (known for being a left-leaning publication) investigates the history of the student loan debt forgiveness movement, beginning with the activism of Occupy Wall Street in (see ) and America's first debtors' union, the Debt Collective.   What does the article describe as the origin of the Debt Collective and the movement to cancel student debt from for-profit colleges?    Why did Gokey decide to focus on forming a debt collective?

For-Profit Colleges and Department of Education Policy  For-profit colleges have defrauded students and led to an increase in student debt; this was a major concern of Occupy Wall Street activists and is described in the following 2014 Last Week Tonight video . In June , the federal Department of Education automatically canceled all debt currently held by Corinthian Colleges students and alumni .    What makes Corinthian and other for-profit colleges different from private nonprofit colleges or public universities?   Do you agree with the Department of Education's actions? Why or why not?   What should the Department of Education do with student loans held by other for-profit colleges, including those who were not as openly fraudulent as Corinthian (who paid companies to hire their students for two days in order to inflate their job placement numbers)?    What should the Department of Education do with student loans held by nonprofit colleges?        Assume for a moment that the Biden-Harris policies you investigated in stay constant for the next years (perhaps an unlikely assumption given the changes in policy between Presidential administrations as well as Supreme Court rulings).   What percentage of the benefit will your age and income group receive years from now?    If you are in one of the groups (single adults earning under a year and married couples earning under a year, plus an additional for Pell Grant recipients) that President Biden targeted for debt forgiveness in , what amount of debt will you have forgiven?    Do you believe that President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness policy is a good idea? Why or why not? Do its benefits for lower-income debtors outweigh its impats on the U.S. budget? Estimate whether your taxes will rise as a result and, if so, by how much, using a well-explained dimensional analysis.    The following note from the Wharton Budget Model describes the income groups listed in : Estimate household income percentile thresholds for 2022 all age: 20%: $28,784; 40%: $50,795; 60%: $82,400; 80%: $141,096; 90% $212,209; 95%: $321,699; 99%: $961,711; 99.9%: $3,668,499.     Given this information, estimate the percentage of the student loan forgiveness plan your income group will receive.     The Congressional Budget Office , a nonpartisan organization within the legislative branch of the United States government, estimated the total cost of Biden's student loan forgiveness program at billion. Use this estimate, together with the information above, to estimate how much total debt relief (in U.S. dollars) your income and age group wlil receive years from now.      President Biden's loan forgiveness program involves an income cap , which means that the program only applies to individuals who earn below or households who earn below each year. According to the Wharton analysis shown in , whether or not an income cap is applied, the most loan forgiveness would go to households earning between and a year.    What income percentile(s) in do these earners belong to?    Assuming that the loan forgiveness policy stays constant for the next years, estimate the percentage of loan forgiveness that will apply to these income percentile(s). Make the simplifying assumption that all student loan borrowers are individuals and not households.    Does the Wharton estimate make sense? Why or why not?      "

This interactive chapter spans up to two weeks of class time, though it can be implemented partially in only one or two class sessions and would be appropriate for a course of any size, particularly one that emphasizes active learning. This chapter can be extended even to a full course in cryptography without prerequisites or to research projects investigating newer cryptosystems such as those arising from knot theory, and it can be implemented as an independent project given sufficient scaffolding.  These activities require no prerequisites other than high school-level algebra skills; the most complicated of which is the solution of systems of two equations in two unknowns, though a more proof-centric approach would benefit from prior student experience with proof techniques. Student proficiency in making factor trees and division with remainder will also be helpful, though these concepts can be reviewed on a just-in-time basis. Students will develop an understanding of the shift cipher, affine cipher, and RSA cryptosystem that is not standard in abstract or modern algebra courses; the only technology required is a calculator capable of reducing expressions modulo n and modular exponentiation, both of which are standard in the Google search box. Students may benefit from programs capable of encrypting and decrypting using shift and affine ciphers such as the open-source tools on the website Cryptii , though the author has successfully asked students to write their own programs in Python to perform these tasks.  We will often elide details of the lesson when introducing more standard abstract algebra topics such as modular arithmetic, systems of congruences, modular inverses, etc. These notes may be implemented with the reader's favorite presentation of these concepts; a couple that are freely available online include .

  "title": "Preliminary Activity",
  "body": " Preliminary Activity  There are many exercises below in which students are asked to analyze plaintext or ciphertext where said text is not specified. These texts may be provided the instructor based on the cryptographic methods described below. This flexibility is emphasized in order to allow customization of the specific texts students will play with, including customizing ciphertexts to a college or university’s context.  It is useful to establish some cryptographic terminology which we will use for the remainder of this text. To that end, consider the definitions below:   Cryptography (from Greek kryptos- , meaning hidden ) is secret communication by hiding the meaning of a message, not its existence. The process of hiding the meaning of a message is called encryption. The recipient of the message has to decrypt or decipher the message in order to read it.  Often the method of encryption relies on a key , some special number(s) or word(s) that only the sender and recipient know. Cryptanalysis is the study of cryptographic algorithms with the intent of recovering secret messages without knowing the secret key.  There are two basic tools that can be used in encryption algorithms: transposition (rearranging the characters) and substitution (replacing characters with other characters). The emphasis of these notes will be on substitution ciphers.  A (substitution)  cipher is an algorithm for encrypting a message into apparently unintelligible text . Each cipher may be viewed as a function where is the space of plaintext , or readable text in a given alphabet (here the English alphabet consisting of the lowercase English letters will be used unless specified otherwise) and is the space of ciphertext or encrypted text (here the uppercase -letter English alphabet unless otherwise specified). We also identify each letter in and , in order, with an element of (so that , etc.). It will be clear from context which representation of and we are using. If is injective (and hence, since here and are finite, bijective), we say it is a monoalphabetic (substitution) cipher .  The use of uppercase in the ciphertext and lowercase in the plaintext is a cryptographic convention designed to distinguish the two types of text, especially in partially-deciphered messages; we will often ignore the distinction and say, for example, is the shift cipher with shift where lowercase denote individual letters. We will commonly refer to a particular which we will call simply the plaintext and its image ( the ciphertext ). Notably, for courses without mathematical prerequisites such as that taught by the other using the flow of concepts below, the spaces and notation and are hidden, and ciphers are analyzed by analyzing particular and , as well as determining given particular .    1 . One may begin by simply giving students various encrypted messages to decode along with a handful of hints. Ask students to work in groups, with one member of each group of 3-4 students serving as the facilitator, the recorder, and the reporter (sharing their work with the class), respectively. For instructors following the order of topics below, it is important that at least one message be a shift cipher , a cipher of form for some . In order for students to be able to systematically decrypt a shift cipher, the message should either be fairly long (students can split the message into pieces when decrypting it) or otherwise rigged so that plaintext e is one of the top three most common letters in the plaintext.    It is recommended to give students two other messages as well. At this stage students are often not prepared for ciphers which are not bijective, so one may use, for example, a keyword cipher  where the keyword is a chosen English word and the plaintext, again, is long enough or otherwise rigged so that the plaintext letters occur with similar relative frequencies to those of English as a whole. Note the following features of the keyword cipher: first the keyword is spelled out under the first letters of the plaintext alphabet, where is the number of distinct letters in the keyword. Then the alphabet is spelled out in order, except that when a letter has already been written as part of the keyword, it is skipped and we move onto the next letter of the alphabet.    The above keyword cipher illustrates a cipher alphabet in function form: a representation of the ordered pair for a given cipher . Of course, any other representation of , such as a table of values, will do (and tables of values are commonly used to represent cipher alphabets). Students often decrypt such a message without identifying the keyword, but it is fruitful to point out that identifying a pattern will assist in the decryption process at this stage.    Finally, it is recommended to assign one unsolved cipher such as that used in Part of the Kryptos sculpture . Pass on (unattributed) to the students the hints that artist Jim Sanborn gave: the ciphertext letters NYPVTT decrypt to BERLIN, and the word immediately following BERLIN is CLOCK. Then, give students time in groups to attempt to solve all three ciphers. Usually many students solve the shift cipher, a good handful (with my assistance) solve the keyword cipher, and generally these students move onto Kryptos, notice it’s not monoalphabetic since (by the hints) , get frustrated, wonder about spacing, and come to a loss. At this stage one may tell them something like, this is an unsolved cipher known as Kryptos Part ; solve it and you’ll be famous!    Follow up by letting them know that we are not trying to be cruel, then ask them why we would give them an unsolved code. Based on our conversation, one may follow up with statements like, What do you think mathematicians spend most of their time doing? How do you define success when working on an unsolved problem? We emphasize that making sense of a problem, increasing their depth of understanding (what methods DON’T work?), describing their process of engagement, and even failing are all completely normal aspects of doing mathematics. Even problems that are solved often took years or even millennia to solve; therefore, there is no shame or cause for alarm if they don’t understand something immediately. This helps ground students as we move onto more and more abstract and difficult mathematics.   Now, ask students what strategies they used to decrypt the messages above. For the first message, students may use brute force, simply trying various shifts until one works. However, a more interesting strategy involves counting which ciphertext letter is the most frequent and guessing that letter corresponds to plaintext e .  "

  "body": " The Caesar\/shift cipher  The Caesar cipher is an example of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher , in which every character is replaced by some other character. It is the earliest known example of a substitution cipher and, according to the Roman historian Suetonius, was used by Julius Caesar himself. It is currently understood as encrypting messages by shifting every letter forward in the alphabet by ; that is, as the function . More generally, a shift cipher may shift every letter forward by any amount.  It is easy to generate example shift ciphertext and have students decrypt this ciphertext. Prompt them to continually investigate the methods they use to cryptanalyze shift ciphers: does it involve brute force? Counting the number of occurrences of each letter and comparing to English letter frequencies, then guessing the most common ciphertext letter corresponds to ? Spotting patterns between adjacent letters? There is no wrong way, but it is the goal of cryptographers to find a general method for decrypting a given family of cipher no matter the particular message or peculiarities of the cipher; therefore, we want to move students’ thinking toward counting letter frequencies as a method of cryptanalyzing any monoalphabetic substitution cipher.  Inform students that there is a faster way to decrypt shift ciphers than saying the alphabet backwards in their heads. Ask them to try decrypting a message that was encrypted with a very large forward shift such as . How would they do it? Likely by shifting each letter forwards by to obtain the plaintext message. This means that in the English alphabet, , and now you can introduce modular arithmetic (working with modulus for the foreseeable future). It’s beneficial to provide students with a letter-to-number correspondence sheet , which numbers English letters in increasing order starting with .    2 . Have students decrypt a message (long enough or rigged so that its letter frequencies are close to those in English in general) that was encrypted using each of the following:      A Caesar cipher .      A shift cipher with a shift other than (without telling students the shift).      A shift cipher with a shift greater than (without telling students the shift).      How many different shift ciphers are there in the English alphabet? In other words, how hard is it to cryptanalyze the shift cipher by brute force?     The usefulness of the clock metaphor for introducing modular arithmetic cannot be overstated: we are thinking of the alphabet as a clock with numbers on it, going from on the top to . Can students determine various times on this clock? Up until this point, students were not likely to fully understand our definition of a cipher as a function modulo , but now they can. The following activity is one I’ve used to help students learn basic modular arithmetic without any prerequisites:    3 .     Reduce several numbers modulo , including numbers much larger than , using various notions of congruence modulo (e.g. if :00 and :00 are the same time on a -hour clock, and have the same remainder upon division by , , subtracting a multiple of from yields ).      Create addition and multiplication tables modulo 5 and modulo 14. What patterns do students notice? What do they wonder about these tables?     "

  "body": " Frequency analysis  To determine the amount of the shift for an unknown shift cipher, the 9th century Iraqi Arab polymath Abu Yūsuf Ya‘qūb ibn ’Isḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ al-Kindı̄, in order to better understand what he saw as God’s messages in the Qu’ran, developed a technique that later became known as frequency analysis . The following passage from his Manuscript on Deciphering Crptographic Messages describes this technique:   One way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the ‘first’, the next most occurring letter the ‘second’, the following most occurring the ‘third’, and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample.  Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve, and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the ‘first’ letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the ‘second’ letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.   In this portion of the project, have students develop their own frequency analysis muscle and hone it into a mental algorithm for cryptanalyzing shift ciphers.    4 . The mnemonic ETAOIN SHRDLU is useful for remembering the relative frequencies of the twelve most common English letters in decreasing order of frequency, although the mnemonic does not reflect all written English and changes with the living language.      (Optional for coding-focused courses) Use the step-by-step module at entitled Frequency Analysis to write a Python frequency analysis tool. Then input several English texts of at least, say, twenty pages, and verify that most of the most frequent twelve letters are in the list ETAOIN SHRDLU.      Take three or four English texts of at least a couple of pages in length (books in the public domain, found online, are a good source of plaintext here). Encrypt these using shifts chosen however you like, then have students use their Python program, or one of the many available frequency analysis applets online, to determine the shifts used to encrypt each message. For additional practice, have them decrypt the first sentence and verify their guessed shift is correct. Note : some texts, especially shorter ones, will require students to guess multiple shifts and test each to see which gives legible plaintext, which verifies that their guess was correct.     "

For example, the material of Chapters through of , from integer division and Diophantine equations to the so-called Chinese (in particular, Sun-tzu) remainder theorem and the theory of cyclic groups, are all motivated by the theory of affine ciphers and can be covered at this stage. We highly recommend calling back to cryptography whenever possible; the following section is an overview of one possible order in which various number-theoretic results can be motivated by the theory of affine ciphers.  Following the presentation of shift ciphers above, students may then practice encrypting and decrypting affine ciphers with known multiplicative and additive keys. Prompt them to consider how they would cryptanalyze an affine cipher. After using frequency analysis, they may determine which ciphertext letter corresponds to , but this is not enough since we need to solve for two unknowns, and . So students may realize we need to find two letter pairs of the form where and set up a system of congruences   Students may remember how they solved systems of equations in high school. It is recommended to encourage them to use elimination, not substitution, in preparation for future linear algebra classes down the road.  A fruitful area of inquiry at this point is to prompt students how, once they obtain a single congruence of the form they might solve for . Usually students think they can simply divide by , so it takes some prompting ( what if ? ) for them to realize this is not always possible modulo . This is a natural spot to introduce the idea of inverses modulo , and more generally modulo . We’ll start with some more basic facts and build up to solving systems of congruences.  The multiplicative inverse of is the number so that , if such an exists. Recall that a number is prime if the only integers that divide it are and itself. Composite numbers are integers greater than one that are not prime. Every positive whole number has a unique prime factorization , i.e. a way to write it as a product of prime numbers. This fact is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.     6 . Have students attempt to encrypt given messages with the affine cipher using various multiplicative and additive keys. To illustrate the relevant idea that is monoalphabetic if and only if , have students use at least one relatively prime to and one that is not (for example , which makes very clear to students that the resulting affine cipher is not monoalphabetic and near-impossible to decrypt even by someone who knows the key).    Ask students: from the work you just did, what multiplicative keys do you think work for affine ciphers? What is the problem with the keys that don’t work? Even if they don’t have a complete sense of the issue, have them explain their hypothesis. Prompt students to make multiplication tables modulo for some reasonably small composite ; ask them to compare what happens in rows which are relatively prime to versus rows that aren’t. How might this connect to the issue with the affine cipher ? What patterns do they notice or wonder about?   Hopefully students will realize that there are significant problems with an affine cipher where !    9 .     At this point, it is useful for students to make themselves a cheat sheet which tells them the multiplicative inverse of any number mod 26, if it exists. (My expectation is not that they memorize such a list, though more power to them if they’d like to!) At this point, the most likely strategy students will use to find is trial and error: multiplying each by various integers mod until they end up with . The number they multiplied by to get is their , if such a number exists. Ask: what relationship between and the modulus predicts whether exists?      In an introduction to proof or number theory class, this would be an excellent time to prompt students to prove that exists modulo if and only if . Prompt them to think about their multiplication tables and the fact that every integer modulo appears in the th row precisely when and are relatively prime. In fact, students can prove that     If is a whole number between and , then divides any number that’s congruent to .     One prompt to lead students toward the general proof is the following specific example: assume some number is congruent to . Then (here denotes remainder in language that should be familiar to students), where is some whole number. So is some multiple of plus ; we can write , where is some whole number. Now, and is divisible by .      At this point, students have the cheat sheet and tools necessary to decrypt affine ciphers with known key. Have them try decrypting some example ciphertext under various affine ciphers. Naturally, students may at first be most comfortable only doing arithmetic modulo , but it takes surprisingly little in my experience to prompt them to consider other moduli. Students may try decrypting affine ciphers in different alphabets at this stage: for example, decrypt using the lowercase English alphabet with !?, appended. We need to multiply both sides by some number so that . How do we systematically find ? This is a great time for an optional detour into the extended Euclidean algorithm; students without much previous college-level math experience often find this difficult, so it may be skipped without losing the thread of this activity.      Students in a proof-based course may now attempt to prove the following corollary of Proposition .     8 . If , then no multiple of is congruent to . In other words, we can’t get every number in row of the multiplication table, and does not have a multiplicative inverse . In fact, the following are equivalent for any whole numbers :      .      any affine cipher with multiplicative key is decryptable by the intended recipient.      every number between and is a multiple of .      has a multiplicative inverse .      An example that may lead students toward part of the proof: consider the affine cipher . Note that . Any plaintext letter that we plug in will spit out some multiple of . Reduced mod , these multiples of all become either or . And divides both and evenly. Since no multiple of can be congruent to , does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo .      Now, prompt students to consider how important it is before decrypting an affine cipher to verify that . Given a cipher like , how could students determine whether the cipher was monoalphabetic, and hence whether our techniques will decrypt it?      Computers can only understand numbers (which are written in s and s), not letters. The computer language ASCII represents all commonly-used written characters as numbers between and . Do you think we can encrypt ASCII messages using the affine cipher ? Why or why not? What multiplicative keys can be used in a monoalphabetic, affine ASCII cipher?     We now may introduce the Euclidean algorithm as a powerful (and programmable) tool for finding greatest common divisors. A recommended way of introducing the Euclidean algorithm, as in much of these notes, is to start with an example.    10 .     Suppose we want to find the greatest common divisor of, say, and . Have students recall (perhaps by verifying a specific example) that, if a number divides both and , then it divides as well. Similarly, if a number divides both and (as it must if it divides and ), then it divides , and , and . Therefore, . Hence, compute and verify it using a method more familiar to you, such as factor trees.      Prove that the Euclidean algorithm works in general to compute for any .      Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcds of two or three pairs of numbers. It may benefit students to make the first pair of numbers relatively small and one of the pairs relatively large such that the pair of large numbers has a quick Euclidean algorithm solution which is nonobvious using the method of factor trees. For example, one may use any pair of numbers of the form for some .      Unicode is an updated version of ASCII. Unicode gives a way of encoding information on a computer with possible numbers. Only about of them are currently in use; say there are Unicode numbers in use. Does the affine cipher encrypt Unicode characters monoalphabetically?     To motivate solving systems of linear congruences, we may use the cryptanalysis of affine ciphers. As in ( ) above, systems of linear congruences arise naturally after guessing two plaintext-ciphertext pairs in an affine cipher. Solving the system is necessary to determine the multiplicative and additive keys of the affine cipher, hence to decrypt it. The dangerous thing for students at this point is to make the wrong guess and end up trying to solve a congruence of the form where . This is an excellent time to discuss the general theory of solving linear congruences, and if you wish even generalize to polynomial, factorial, and other more general congruences. At any rate, students may now use the following algorithm to cryptanalyze any monoalphabetic affine cipher:    Form a system of linear congruences to solve for , the multiplicative constant, and , the additive constant.    Simplify the system of congruences by substitution, elimination, or addition\/subtraction of congruences.    Find the solution of the resulting congruence using trial and error or the extended Euclidean algorithm.    Use and to decrypt the ciphertext using the formula mod .    To accomplish step , students must guess two plaintext-ciphertext pairs, and to avoid insoluble congruences, it suffices to always guess the ciphertext corresponding to plaintext . Students can type the messages into an online frequency analysis tool to get a frequency count, or, in a more programming-focused course, the collection of Python modules at includes a module in which students write a frequency analysis tool themselves in Python.  Students may notice one issue with this algorithm: what if you have no idea what ciphertext letter corresponds to plaintext in your message? Certainly English messages may have different most-common letters. This could lead to a lesson on the index of coincidence and other probabilistic methods for determining both which cipher we’re dealing with and matching letter frequencies. Though these concepts are beyond the scope of these notes as written, see Chapter of for an excellent treatment without prerequisites.    11 .     Encrypt some short ( - words) plaintext using an affine cipher of your choice. Now, give students the equation of the affine cipher (say, ) and have students determine the decryption equation for that affine cipher by solving for in the cipher’s equation. Finally, use that decryption equation to determine the plaintext corresponding to each given ciphertext letter , and hence decrypt the message.      Encrypt some short ( - words) plaintext in which the most common letter is e and the second-most common is t ) using an affine cipher of your choice. Now, have students use the algorithm to cryptanalyze this affine ciphertext.     At this point in the project, one may introduce the Vigenère cipher and its primary tools for cryptanalysis, the Kasiski and Friedman tests. This leads naturally to asking what happens when a Vigenère keyword is as long as the message it’s used to encrypt, whence students can prove to themselves that such a cipher (a one-time pad ) is theoretically unbreakable by showing that different keywords lead to intelligible, but different, plaintext messages. The Enigma machine is then introduced as a portable one-time pad generator, providing an opportunity to tie the course to the more recent history of World War II.  However, because these concepts are less explicitly connected to number theory and algebra, they are omitted in this text.

  "body": " Extensions and Alterations   These resources are currently used at a small liberal arts college in an entire first-year seminar course entitled Making & Breaking Secret Codes. As such, the project described above is supplemented with additional material and assignments such as the Python modules and pre-class Reading Questions, often from .  In this course, most of the material in (which is also provided to students as a supplementary resource) is discussed, with the possible exception of probability, which is often left out due to time constraints. A sample of the discussion of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and modular exponentiation is provided in a Subsection . These notes lead into the material on the square-and-multiply algorithm, Euler’s Theorem, and eventually RSA encryption described in . Sometimes, the extended Euclidean algorithm is also introduced after describing the importance of finding multiplicative inverses when cryptanalyzing the affine cipher, though students without much prior mathematical experience tend to find this material confusing and somewhat intimidating.  This activity has not yet been extended to a research project; however, some ideas for such projects are included in Subsection .  Finally, these notes arose from a course originally taught in the Duke TIP summer program which included an evening session in which students were walked through the Python modules found in . It is highly recommended to guide students through these modules if they are used, since students without prior coding experience often find Python, especially its ubiquitous and sometimes uninformative syntax error messages, intimidating. The Python modules could also be used as the backbone for an independent study on the use of programming in cryptography and\/or to introduce the material described above.    The Diffie-Hellman key exchange  In order to introduce more contemporary (i.e., post- ) cryptography, specifically public-key cryptography, it is recommended to start with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The idea is introduced via discussion of the problem of informing the intended recipient what key to use to send an encrypted message (the key distribution problem ), quite a significant issue: if one lives in a government where all Internet traffic is subject to government search, for example, how does one send a message across the world? Students often suggest physically transporting a key or sending a person to tell the recipient the key, but that just reframes the problem in terms of safely getting the key or person physically to the intended location.  At this stage, students engage in a Socratic dialogue on whether it’s possible to solve the key distribution problem. In other words, suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and suppose they live in a country in which any unencrypted message, or any key, will be intercepted and read by the postal service. For this discussion, imagine that Alice has a physical key that she wants to send to Bob in such a way that it can’t be opened by the postal service. How could Alice do this?  One way that students eventually arrive at to solve this problem is that Alice can somehow secure the key so that it can’t be opened before Bob receives it. However, this begs the question of how Bob can access the key. Some semesters students discover the analogy used by Simon Singh in his excellent Code Book  , which is usually assigned as a required text to provide students with historical background. Singh’s presentation is eminently readable without sacrificing accuracy or detail.  In any case, the analogy works in the following steps:    Alice places her key inside a box and uses a padlock to lock the box. Alice keeps the key to the padlock and sends the locked box to Bob.    The box can’t be opened in transit without Alice’s key. When Bob receives the box, he places an additional padlock on the box and keeps the key to his padlock. Bob then sends the doubly-locked box back to Alice.    Again, the box can’t be opened in transit without both Alice and Bob’s keys. When Alice receives the box, she unlocks her padlock and sends the box back to Bob.    Finally, the box can’t be unlocked in transit without Bob’s key. However, once Bob receives the box, he simply unlocks his padlock and opens the box.    This little story provides a solution to one of the oldest and most important problems in cryptography, the key exchange problem . Exchanging keys (whether physical or cryptographic) is a deeply vulnerable part of cryptography, and historically, if Alice and Bob wanted to exchange secret messages, they must first meet or somehow transmit a secret key unencrypted . Anyone who intercepts the key would be able to read any purportedly secret messages sent between Alice and Bob.  Now, the astute reader may notice that the analogy above requires double-encryption with our given cipher to be commutative. Students then investigate which ciphers discussed so far actually have this property. This is a worthwhile pre-class activity to assign: is the shift cipher commutative? That is, if we want to encrypt a message with two consecutive shift ciphers, does it matter which order we use (it does not)? What about affine ciphers (it does)? Vigenère ciphers (it does not)? Other ciphers?  What is really needed is a mathematical process that works more like padlocks than socks and shoes. In other words, we want to be able to have Alice and Bob each add their locks, then take them off in the opposite order in order to decrypt the message. And we want to do this without it being possible for anyone who intercepts the message to decrypt it! We want a trapdoor one-way function (easy to encrypt, hard to decrypt without the key) in which encryption with two keys is the same as decryption. A one-way function that arose in the affine cipher is multiplication mod - finding inverses is hard!  This stage is a perfect time to introduce modular exponentiation and the theory behind it, which turns out to be the lock we use for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Though the treatment in these notes ends here, the treatment in is recommended for courses without prerequisites, or the instructor’s favorite number theory book for proof-based courses. These suggested materials also include the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, an introduction to Euler’s totient function, Fermat’s Little Theorem, Euler’s Theorem on the totient function, and proofs of all theorems involved appropriate in level for an introductory abstract algebra or number theory course.    Potential undergraduate research projects  The following are research projects that may be suitable for undergraduates who have a reasonable grasp on the material above and are interested in continuing to explore cryptography. In particular, these have been considered as research directions in a two-month summer undergraduate research program where the goal for students is primarily to gain mathematical maturity (defined here as gaining the ability to read research papers and to experience working on unsolved problems), not necessarily to prove publishable results.    Read . Invent and test a new hash function. Perturb some conditions and see what happens.    Read . Perturb some conditions in Rejewski’s Theorems and see what happens.    Read Problem in and its solution. Though this problem has already been solved, students could solve similar problems, perhaps by changing the seed or experimenting with determining the periods of the sequences generated from various seeds.    Read . How could one break this cryptosystem? Investigate Shor’s algorithm and the ability of quantum computers to cryptanalyze RSA. How could Bob know how to mutate the knots without using RSA? Investigate alternate key exchange algorithms (besides public or private key encryption). Could one use a public knot whose inverse is hard to find and mimic RSA?     "

  "title": "Reflections and Advice",
  "body": " Reflections and Advice  Learning about elementary ciphers has historically provided even first-year students with the motivation and context to gain experience and facility with modular arithmetic, including the idea of multiplicative inverses and the structure of finite cyclic groups. These ideas could easily lead to an examination of a broader range of group theory, for example in the context of an abstract algebra course, or become the first few weeks of a seminar course on the mathematics of code-making and code-breaking without prerequisites, as it has been implemented at the author’s institution. These notes are more than suitable for independent study or summer programs for motivated high-school students; in fact, this is how they first originated.  It is very useful to undergird a discussion of this material with a very elementary introduction to Python programming, since all contemporary cryptography happens on computers and many more recent ciphers are incredibly cumbersome to implement by hand. The website CoCalc , by the makers of the SageMath computing software (which runs on top of Python), provides an online interface allowing students to program without installing any Python distributions on their own computers, saving headache. This website is not free, but each student is able to pay about $12 toward upgrading their CoCalc projects for one semester. The free version of CoCalc is almost unusable due to lag, so upgrading is recommended. The costs of such an upgrade can be implemented as course fees or more informally. The Python modules, as well as rubrics and solutions used to grade them, can be found at the author’s GitHub page .  The points of struggle mentioned above for students are worth reflecting on. These include multiple issues with learning to program for the first time: wading through confusing syntax errors, understanding the importance of whitespace in Python functions, and determining where to edit the preexisting code given to them. These issues can be somewhat ameliorated by walking through portions of Python modules as a whole class, breaking down the code underlying a function line by line to connect it to the more familiar steps of implementing a cipher by hand, and emphasizing that students are not expected to write their own code, only to change a word or two in the code provided for them. That said, students still tend to find Python, and programming, to be one of their least favorite aspects of what is generally a very fun course to teach and, per my students, to participate in. Other points of struggle include the extended Euclidean algorithm (due to the amount of symbolic manipulation involved), the complexity of the Enigma machine’s components, and more generally the concept of modular arithmetic (though students usually gain understanding quickly by way of the clock metaphor). Feedback is welcome on any of the material above. Cryptography is very fun, yet it provides a window for first-year students into material not usually taught until a first course in abstract algebra, as well as motivation for more experienced students to learn number theory.

  "title": "Understanding the Issue",
  "body": " Understanding the Issue  The earth's climate is constantly changing, with periods of warming and cooling alternating throughout history and prehistory. Scientists are able to measure the earth's climate by using temperature records for the last roughly 150 years, and using reconstruction from ice cores and seafloor cores before that. There are many factors that cause the earth's climate to change, including changes in the sun, changes in the tilt of the earth's axis, meteorites, volcanos, and changes in vegetation . Some of these changes, like changes in the sun or the tilt of the earth's axis, happen slowly over millions of years and cause similarly slow changes in climate.  Rapid changes in climate tend to be caused by natural disasters, like volcanic eruptions. These changes tend to be small and localized, unless the natural disaster is cataclysmic - like the event, theorized to be caused by a meteor strike in the Yucatan peninsula, which caused the extinction of many dinosaurs between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. This event caused a global temperature drop of  . Changes in climate due to cataclysmic events - even like the one which caused the last mass extinction before modern times - tend to be temporary. That severe cooling event only lasted for 3-4 years.  The world is currently experiencing such a cataclysmic rise in global temperatures. While the global temperature has been higher in the past - for example, during the Cretaceous period - there is no evidence that the world has experienced such a rapid warming period over the past million year . Global temperatures have risen by C since records started in 1880, with 2\/3 of that warming coming since 1975 - indicating that warming is accelerating . Projections indicate that the globe could warm by in the 21st century alone .  Unlike past changes to the climate, the current change is driven almost entirely by the actions of a single species - ours. As early as the 1820s, the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier realized that the Earth's atmosphere must trap some of the sun's warmth - otherwise the Earth would be as cold as the moon . In 1859, the Irish physicist John Tyndall proved in a laboratory setting that certain gases - including water vapor ( ), carbon dioxide ( ), and methane ( ) - were trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In 1896, a Swedish physicist, Svante Arrhenius, who was studying carbon dioxide levels during the current time and during the last ice age, coined the term greenhouse effect  .   The Greenhouse Effect  The greenhouse effect refers to the way that certain gases, primarily water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone, trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere. These four gases are commonly called greenhouse gases .   The greenhouse effect is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. In fact, without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be a lifeless shell. The moon receives essentially the same solar energy as the Earth, but its surface temperatures swing between F ( C) during the day to F ( C) at night . The greenhouse effect traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, releasing it more slowly, and creates a temperature range where life can exist. The Earth's natural cycles and processes cause many slow, gradual changes to these greenhouse gases, resulting in slow, gradual fluctuations in the Earth's temperatures.  The current global warming is being driven by a very rapid increase in the amount of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This increase can be explained primarily by human changes to the planet - the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture. As human beings produce more of these greenhouse gases, the global climate has warmed at a corresponding rate. The corresponding changes to the Earth's climate are called anthropogenic climate change .   Anthropogenic Climate Change  Anthropogenic climate change is change to the Earth's climate resulting from human causes, as opposed to climate change caused by natural causes, like volcanic eruptions, natural fluctuations in greenhouse gases, or changes to solar energy.   There are actually several different types of human activity which can cause changes to climate, aside from greenhouse gas emissions. One example is human-caused changes to the Earth's albedo - the lightness or darkness of the Earth's surface. Lighter colored materials tend to reflect more sunlight, causing a cooling effect, while darker colored materials tend to absorb more sunlight. Human activity has caused some areas of the Earth's surface to become darker, like urban areas and areas which were once covered in snow and ice, and thus to absorb more heat. We have also caused other areas to become lighter, like forests that have been replaced by fields and areas which have become desert, creating a cooling effect (like the moon, deserts tend to be very hot during the day and very cold at night).  The amount of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, though, vastly outweighs all other sources. The amount of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere has, in the last 100 years, risen to levels not seen in the last 400,000 years.    Graph showing atmospheric co2 over the last 400,000 years. Image description available.  Atmospheric CO2 levels for the past 400,000 years. Image Description .     This unprecedented rapid change to greenhouse gas levels has caused a corresponding rapid increase in global temperatures. While the Earth's biosphere (a collective term for all life on the planet, including plants, animals, and all other organisms, and the environments that support that life) has survived changes of similar magnitude in the past, those changes have been much slower. The natural processes of evolution which allow life to adapt to climate changes tend to happen slowly, over many generations. So, while some species with very short life-cycles (like bacteria, or even insects) may be able to adapt to the changes through evolution, longer-lived species will only be able to survive by moving to another area. Scientists estimate that 95% of species will experience local extinction (meaning either extinction or departure from that area) after a C risee in temperatures, and that 16-30% of species could go extinct by 2070 .  While human beings are unlikely to go extinct - our intelligence has made us more adaptable than other species - climate change has already begun to affect our species. Research has shown that production of the 10 largest crops in the world has already dropped by 1% since 1974 below where it would be without the impact of climate change . The United Nations High Commission on Refugees estimates that between 2008 and 2019, there were over 21.5 million displacements of people - when an individual was forced to flee their home - caused by weather-related events, more than twice as many as those caused by conflicts or violence . The same data shows that climate disasters like droughts, cyclones, and floods can have destabilizing effects on countries, especially those already experiencing conflict, like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Mozambique.  Climate change - and the greenhouse gas emissions which are driving that change are a major concern for people around the world. The need to find solutions to this crisis becomes more urgent with every passing year. Mathematics can help us to understand the causes of the greenhouse effect and to determine the best strategies for slowing - and one day stopping - the pace of climate change.  "

We can get around easily with cars, fly (relatively) cheaply when we go on vacation, eat the food that we want, and buy all of the things that we want. All of the things that we do produce greenhouse gases, at some level.  Some individuals, though, benefit more than others. The corporations that produce the goods we buy - our cars, plastics, electronics, and food - are motivated to keep selling more stuff, even if that stuff produces greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies make money by extracting and selling fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and petroleum. All of this economic activity contributes to government tax revenues, which allows politicians to spend more money on their constituents and special interests.  In short, unless you live in a cabin in the woods, grow all of your own food, and use energy only from zero-emissions sources (even a campfire generates greenhouse gases), you're benefiting from greenhouse gas emissions. If you own a car company or an oil company (or have stock in them), you're benefiting a lot more.  "

Answers you might have given:  1,000 is 900 more than 100.  100 is 900 less than 1,000.  100 is 1\/10 as big as 1,000.  1,000 is 10 times as big as 100.     Reflection question: Look at the different ways of comparing those two numbers. What are the benefits of each of these comparisons? What are some reasons for not using some of these comparisons? Why might someone choose to use one way of comparing instead of another?   How can you compare the following sets of numbers?  1,000,000,000,000 and 10  545,430,089,384,398,938,938,398,983,982,345,523,234,942 and 9,293,983,983,298,982,983,483  0.0000000001 and 10,000,000,000,000,000    You can compare these numbers in the same ways as the ways you might have chosen to compare 100 and 1000, but they may not be as meaningful or useful. Instead, you might want to see Can you think of any other ways to compare these numbers?    Powers of Ten is a (slightly outdated) movie from the 1970s which shows how the different powers of ten are related.   Understanding very large numbers can be hard to do. Some strategies for trying to understand very large numbers are:   Breaking the number down into smaller pieces. For example, say you were trying to understand the number $1,000,000,000 (1 billion dollars). If you made $100 an hour, and you worked full-time (40 hours per week in the US), 50 weeks a year, it would take 5000 years for you to earn $1,000,000,000...and that doesn't even account for taxes!   Changing the units of the number can be helpful, especially when there is another unit which might help you understand better. The Aqua satellite, used to measure greenhouse gas emissions, orbits 2,300,000 feet above the Earth. This large number is easier to comprehend if you convert it into 436 miles   Comparing the quantity to something else you already can envision. The 2,300,000 feet or 436 miles we found in the previous bullet is still somewhat difficult to understand. Thinking of this as the distance from Washington D.C. to Boston, or from San Diego to San Jose, can be more helpful (at least if you've been to those cities).  Looking at the quantity per person, or per unit area, or per some other unit. In 2020, the US used 763 million gallons of oil, on average, every day . That is a little bit more than 2 gallons per person.     What is Scientific Notation?  So far, we have been writing numbers using decimal notation. Decimal notation is our usual way of writing the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to talk about a number. But, sometimes decimal notation can make it more difficult to understand really big or really small numbers. Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in order to make the numbers easier for people to understand. Scientific notation also makes it easier to write down numbers that would be very long in decimal notation.   Scientific Notation  We say a number is in scientific notation if it is written in the form where A is the first non-zero digit in the number, and power is the appropriate power.   To put a number into scientific notation, we first figure out what the place is of the first nonzero digit. Each place in a number corresponds to a power of 10 - for example, the hundreds place corresponds to , while the millions place corresponds to . If , then is a 1 followed by 0s. The ones place is .  For negative values of , we get decimals. For example, , one-tenth. , one one-thousandth.  To do arithmetic with numbers in scientific notation, you proceed differently depending on what you're doing.   To multiply\/divide numbers in scientific notation, you can divide both the decimal part and the exponent part separately.   To add or subtract numbers in scientific notation, you'll need to write them both with the same power (use whichever power is larger), and then add or subtract the decimal parts.   If you end up with a zero in front of the decimal, you'll need to move the decimal place over one or more places:    Try this yourself in the examples below. Don't worry about rounding - we'll talk about how to decide how many decimal places to round to in the next section.   Find the product of and .       Find the sum of and .        Significant figures  When working with numbers with lots of decimal digits, how many digits should you keep? This is the idea behind signficant figures .   Significant Figures  The number of significant figures or significant digits in a number which has been rounded is the total number of digits written, minus any leading zeros (zeros written before the first non-zero digit). Numbers that have not been rounded have an infinite number of significant figures.   For example, the number 123.4567 has 7 significant digits, but so does the number 0.0001234567. The number 1.234567000 has 10 significant digits, because we count the zeros which aren't leading zeros.   The population of the United States was 328,239,523 in 2019 . How many significant digits does this number have?   There are 9 significant digits here.    In a number written in scientific notation, we count the significant digits the same way. For example, the number has 5 significant digits (notice that this is the same as if we had written it as ).    The United States emitted the equivalent of metric tons of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gases during 2019 . How many significant figures are there in this number?    There are 4 significant figures.    Significant figures are important because they tell us how accurate numbers are. Say we wanted to know what the average CO2 emissions per person were in the United States. We can take the numbers we had in the last two examples and divide: The calculator produces a number of digits here, but how can we know how many values to round to? Significant figures give us a way to decide this.   When multiplying or dividing two numbers, round to the smaller number of significant digits.  When adding or subtracting two numbers, round to the smaller number of decimal places (significant figures after the decimal point).   For our example above, since the population number has 9 significant digits, and the CO2 emissions only has 4, we will round to 4 decimal places and say that the emissions per person is metric tons per person. Compare this to what we do when we subtract.  Say we want to know how many more tons of CO2 equivalents per person were emitted in the US than in China. In 2019, China had (5 significant figures) of CO2 equivalent emissions , and the population was 1,433,783,686 (10 significant figures) . So in China, the emissions per person were Since we're dividing, we keep 5 significant figures and get tons of CO2 equivalent emissions per person. If we want to know how many more tons are emitted per person in the US, we subtract: Since we are subtracting, we take the lesser of the significant figures after the decimal - 2 in this case. So we round the answer to 10.02 metric tons more per person.  What’s that big ‘E’ on my calculator? You’ve probably seen an output like this before on your calculator.  The second line might look really complicated, but this is just the way your calculator was programmed to write numbers in scientific notation. The product of 315,246 and 134,512,361 is too big to fit all of it on the calculator screen in one line. So, the calculator programmers decided to represent that product using scientific notation. 4.240448376E13 means the same thing as .  But, not all calculators use ‘E’ to describe very large or very small numbers. Desmos provides an online scientific calculator that anyone can use. If you try to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers with more than 9 digits, Desmos will automatically write them in scientific notation. Instead of using the capital E, Desmos writes scientific notation the same way that we've seen.  An important note: There are other symbols that you might see sometimes on your calculator that look similar to this capital E, but they actually mean very different things.    : The lowercase e is a number that is important for lots of applications of mathematics. The name of this number is the same as the name of the letter: e. It is equal to about 2.71828, and should not be confused with the scientific notation symbol.   :This symbol, which looks like a sideways W, is called ‘sigma’. Sigma is a Greek letter, and it is sometimes used in mathematics to talk about addition.    "

  "title": "Data Visualization",
  "body": " Data Visualization   Any organized collection of information used to understand or solve a problem is called data . When you think of data, you may think of a long list of numbers which represent a measurement. However, this isn't generally the most useful way to look at a set of data. When we look at data, we use data visualizations to help us understand the data more quickly and efficiently. You're probably familiar with at least one type of data visualization, the graph, but we'll explore some more of the variety of ways in which people look at data in this module.    Types of Data  To understand data visualization, we first need to understand a bit about the way mathematicians talk about different kinds of data. Mathematicians broadly divide data into two types:   Qualitative (Categorical) Data  Data which is not numerical is called qualitative (or categorical) data. Qualitative data can include things like names, categories of objects or people (which is where the other name, categorical, comes from), or different things which are being compared.    Quantitative Data  Data which can be represented numerically is called quantitative data. This includes both data which is already numerical, and data which can be made numerical. Dates are a good example of quantitative data that isn't always written in numbers (for example, \"March\" doesn't seem numerical, but can be represented by 3 since it is the 3rd month of the year).  Quantitative data naturally falls into one of two types - discrete and continuous . While there are more complicated ways to distinguish between them mathematically, for our purpose the big difference is that with quantitative discrete data we have a small number of distinct possible responses, while with quantitative continuous data we have a large number of different possible responses.   It is important to be able to distinguish between quantitative discrete and quantitative continous data, because we visualize them in different ways. Quantitative discrete data is characterized by:  Small number of different values.  Many values are repeated.  Often (but not always) quantitative discrete data is counts of objects.  Quantitative continuous data is characterized by:  Many different values.  Most data values are distinct or only occur a few times.  Often (but not always) quantitative continuous data are measurements.      Two boxes filled with numbers. The box on the left displays an example containing quantitative discrete data with many repeated values: 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, and 4. The box on the right contains quantitative continuous data with many different distinct values: 31, 53, 63, 18, 42, 31, 57, 86, 78, 29, 49, 22, 48, 85, 23, 19, 94, 11, 41, 31, 19, 17, 82, and 83.   Quantitative discrete (left) vs. Quantitative continuous (right) data.   Let's look at some data and decide whether it's qualitative, qunatitative discrete, or quantitative continuous.   A survey asks people how many cars they own.  Would the answers here be numeric or non-numeric? Are multiple people likely to give the same answer? Would you expect to have many different answers?  Quantitative Discrete. The answer is a number, and most people will answer 0, 1, or 2, with with very few people giving larger numbers.    A researcher collects a list of the companies which emit the most methane into the atmosphere.  Would this data be numeric or non-numeric?  This is qualitative data - the data we are collecting consists of company names, not numbers.    A scientist measures the amount of ozone in parts per million in the atmosphere at a particular location every day for a year. Note: here the scientist is collecting two different (connected) pieces of data - the measurement of ozone and the day on which they collected it.  Would this data be numeric or non-numeric? Are many of the measurements likely to be exactly the same on multiple days? Would you expect to have a lot of different values?  Both data sets are quantitative continuous. The dates will be different on every day, and there will be many (365 or 366) different values. The measurements are also unlikely to be exactly the same on different days, and there will be many different values.     Graphs   Small amounts of data can be represented through things like lists and tables, but more complicated data is easier to understand through a visual representation. Visual representations of data allow us to see patterns and trends in the data that would be much harder to detect in a simple list or table.  The most common types of visual representation of data are called graphs or charts . While you're probably familiar with many types of graphs, we'll be introducing some that you may not be familiar with, and focusing on how and when to use the different types. There are many different types of graphs, because each one is used to display different types of information and highlight different aspects of that information. In the following subsubsections, we'll go through each of the types of graphs    Bar Graphs  A bar graph is a graph which represents data as bars of various heights. A bar graph can be used in several different ways.  The first way that a bar graph can be used is to display a single set of qualitative or quantitative discrete data. This is done by taking a data set and translating it into a frequency table .   Frequency Table A frequency table lists each of the distinct values in a data set followed by the frequency of that value - the number of times that it appears in the data set.  An example of a frequency table, which displays a quantitative discrete data set is given below. The American Community Survey, part of the US Census, asks Americans how many vehicles their household has access to (either owned or shared). The number of vehicles is quantitative discrete because most households in the USA have access to 0, 1, 2, or 3 cars. The data from 2019 is shown in the table :     Number of Vehicles Available  Millions of Households    0  10.6    1  39.8    2  45.3    3  18.1    4  6.3    5+  2.7     This data can be turned into a bar graph which uses the frequency (the number of households in millions that gave a particular response) as the height of the bars.    Bar graph showing vehicle access per household. Image description available.  Vehicle Access per household from the 2019 American Community Survey. Image Description .    If your data set is quantitative continuous, you can still create a frequency table, but you need to sort the data into ranges. If you don't, most of your data values will have very low frequencies, and you'll have a ton of different values to graph. A bar graph which displays quantitative continuous data with that data sorted into ranges is called a histogram .  The data below represents the per capita emissions, in tons of CO2 per person, of 97 nations across the world. You can see from the data that if we look at the frequency of each value, almost all of them have frequency 1 (a handful, like 0.09 and 0.13, have frequency 2). Creating a bar graph of these values wouldn't be very useful, but if we sort them into categories - 0 to 5, 5 to 10, etc. - we can see more patterns in the data.  0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.09, 0.09, 0.13, 0.13, 0.23, 0.25, 0.26, 0.29, 0.32, 0.36, 0.38, 0.52, 0.55, 0.56, 0.6, 0.67, 0.85, 0.86, 0.99, 1.01, 1.05, 1.09, 1.1, 1.11, 1.13, 1.23, 1.46, 1.52, 1.59, 1.68, 1.69, 1.74, 1.76, 1.92, 1.94, 1.95, 2, 2.19, 2.3, 2.37, 2.38, 2.45, 2.48, 2.5, 2.52, 2.56, 2.66, 2.72, 2.75, 3.38, 3.48, 3.58, 3.66, 3.79, 4.02, 4.08, 4.17, 4.21, 4.53, 4.64, 4.66, 4.83, 5.18, 5.67, 5.67, 5.76, 5.81, 5.94, 6.2, 7.08, 7.2, 7.46, 7.64, 7.67, 7.87, 8.31, 8.41, 8.76, 9, 9.07, 9.85, 12.76, 12.96, 14.49, 14.82, 15.25, 16.44, 17.69, 18.82, 19.31, 21.12, 23.47, 31.45, 36.46  Notice that in making our categories, we're careful to not let them overlap - we don't want to accidentally count a value, like 10, that is on the edge in two categories. We also want to make sure that we don't have too many different categories. While you can make a histogram with as many categories as you like, it's generally best to keep the number of categories small, so that there are a lot of data elements in most of them. If you use too many categories, then you will be back in the situation where almost every column contains just one or two elements.     Per Capita Emissions  Number of Countries    [0,5)  65    [5,10)  19    [10,15)  4    [15,20)  5    [20,25)  2    [25,30)  0    [30,35)  1    [35,40)  1       Histogram showing the number of countries with per capita emissions at a particular level. Image description available.   Countries in the world, sorted by their per capita CO2 emissions in tons of CO2 per person. Data from . Image Description .   A bar graph can also be used to display a correspondence between two different types of data, as long as one of them is quantitative. The quantitative data will be used for the height of the bar. For example, the table below shows the amount of methane produced by the ten countries which produce the most greenhouse gases, in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide. The country names are qualitative data, and each country has a corresponding quantitative continuous value which represents the amount of methane they produce. This data is taken from .     Country  Total Methane Emissions in Equivalent Tons of CO2    China  1.17E+10    United States  5.51E+09    India  3.04E+09    Japan  1.17E+09    Brazil  9.39E+08    Germany  7.84E+08    Canada  6.52E+08    Saudi Arabia  6.26E+08    Australia  5.02E+08    United Kingdom  4.38E+08     You can create a bar graph for this data by creating a bar for each country, and using the amount of methane as the height of the bar.    Graph showing bars with sizes corresponding to the methane emissions of 10 countries, dominated by China, the United States, and India. Image description available.   Methane Emissions of the ten largest polluters, in the equivalent amount of CO2. Data from . Image Description    To summarize, bar graphs are generally used to display a single set of data or to show a correspondence between two data sets. They are one of the most versatile and flexible forms of data visualization, and can be used in a variety of contexts. Unless there is a good reason to choose another type of graph, a bar graph is usually the best way to take a first look at a set of data.    Pie Charts  A pie chart is a specialized type of graph which is used to display a single set of data. It is usually used when there are a small number of different data values (less than 10), but can be used effectively with more. In a pie chart, a circle is divided into wedges, with each wedge corresponding to a different data value or group of data values. The size of the wedge is determined by the percentage of the data which matches that data value or group of values.  To create a pie chart, you should first create a frequency table. However, unlike a bar graph, to create a pie chart you need to know the relative frequency .   Relative Frequency The relative frequency of a data value is the percentage of overall values which match that data value. It can be calculated by taking the frequency and dividing it by the total number of data values.  Let's add relative frequency to . First, we calculate the total number of data values, by adding up all the frequencies. There are 122.8 million households total in this data set. To find the relative frequency, we just take each frequency and divide by 122.8. For example, because 10.57 million households do not have access to a car at all, the relative frequency of the data value 0 is   We repeat this for each value to fill in the rest of the frequency table.     Number of Vehicles Available  Millions of Households  Percentage of Households    0  10.57  9%    1  39.82  32%    2  45.29  37%    3  18.09  15%    4  6.30  5%    5+  2.74  2%    Total  122.80       Once we have a frequency table with relative frequency, we can create a pie chart. To create a pie chart, divide the circle into wedges, where each wedge takes up some percentage of the total circle. Those percentages should match the relative frequencies in your frequency table. Making a pie chart by hand can be tricky, because you need to estimate what different percentages of the circle would be.    A circle divided into wedges, one for each data value in the table above, with the size of the wedge determined by the relative frequency.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in the United States, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from .   For quantitative continuous data, your wedges of the pie chart will correspond to ranges of values instead of individual values. For example, here is the data from , with relative frequencies:     Per Capita Emissions  Number of Countries  Relative Frequency    [0,5)  65  67%    [5,10)  19  20%    [10,15)  4  4%    [15,20)  5  5%    [20,25)  2  2%    [25,30)  0  0%    [30,35)  1  1%    [35,40)  1  1%    Total  97       When we create a pie chart from this data, we get the following image    A circle divided into wedges, one for each range of values in the table. Image description available.   Number of countries with per capita CO2 emissions in the given ranges. Image description .   Note that in the image, several wedges represent very small percentages of the total number of countries. This provides very little information and makes the graph more cluttered. Let's re-do our frequency table, combining all of the categories above 20 tons per person into one group:     Per Capita Emissions  Number of Countries  Relative Frequency    [0,5)  65  67%    [5,10)  19  20%    [10,15)  4  4%    [15,20)  5  5%    > 20  4  4%    Total  97       The pie chart now has only 5 categories, and is much less cluttered. The information - that most countries have CO2 emissions less than 5 tons per person, and that only a few countries have very high per capita emissions, is now presented much more clearly.    A circle divided into wedges, one for each data value in the table above, with the size of the wedge determined by the relative frequency.   Number of countries with per capita CO2 emissions in the given ranges.     Scatterplots and Line Graphs  Our next type of graph is used when we have a correspondence between two quantitative continuous data sets. In a scatterplot , we plot a point on the x-y coordinates which represents a pair of data values. Those points, then, can reveal patterns in how the data sets are related.  Our data set for this example will consist of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of how wealthy a country is, and CO2 emissions. Both of these numbers will naturally be larger for larger countries, because more people will produce more wealth and more CO2, so we consider the per capita numbers, meaning the amount of money or CO2 per person. We can get these numbers by taking the total amount and dividing by the population of the country. If you already know that there is a relationship between data sets because of something like population, dividing out by the value is an easy way to eliminate that relationship. This is called normalizing the data set.  Because our data set has these values for 165 countries, we will not include the data table in the text. The data can be found in gdp and co2 emissions for all countries in 2018 [Excel Spreadsheet] (data from ). We can construct a scatterplot by taking each pair of values and creating a point. For example, the nation of Qatar has per capita CO2 emissions of 39.27 tons per person, and a GDP of $153,764 per person. This is because Qatar is a very small nation (Qatar only had 2.7 million people in 2018, when this data was collected) which produces a large amount of oil - oil production is a major source of CO2 emissions and countries with large oil production tend to use more fossil fuels. Qatar would be marked by a dot at x = 39.27, and y = 153,764. Yemen, a country close to Qatar, but much poorer and with much less oil production (and which was fighting a civil war in 2018) has per capita CO2 emissions of only 0.35 tons per person, and a per capita GDP of only $2,285 per person. The dot for Yemen would be at x=0.35 and y=2,285.  Here is a scatterplot of the entire data set:    Scatterplot of the gdp and co2 data. Image description available.   Scatterplot of the relationship between GDP and CO2, per capita, of nations in 2018. Image Description .   Scatterplots are useful because they help us see patterns in the data. In this graph, we can see that for countries with low emissions and low GDP, an increase in GDP generally corresponds to an increase in CO2 emissions. This makes sense, because we associate increased economic activity with increased usage of fossil fuels. We see this especially in the dot for Qatar, located at the extreme right & top of the graph. However, a number of wealthier nations, including Norway (84,580, 8.21), Singapore (68,402, 6.65), Ireland (64,684, 8.85), Switzerland (61,373, 4.33), and Sweden (45,542, 4.19) don't fit this trend, having much lower emissions than nations with similar GDPs. Similarly, there are a number of nations with much higher emissions than countries with similar GDPs - Trinidad & Tobago (28,549, 27.24), Mongolia (13,383, 20.35), Kazakhstan (25,308, 17.45), and Bahrain (39,499, 20.14). While you can see this from looking at the data table, it is much easier to see these data points that stand out (called outliers ) from looking at the scatterplot.  Each of these countries has a unique reason why their CO2 emissions are lower or higher than expected from GDP. Do some research on your own and see if you can explain why they don't fit the general trend of the other points.  When we have two quantitative continuous data sets where there are no repeated values in one data set, a type of scatterplot called a line graph can be used. In a line graph, the data set with no repeated values is marked on the horizontal axis. Adjacent points are then connected by short lines.  Line graphs are used to imply that, although we do not have data values for every x-axis value, we can assume that the data between values follows a similar pattern. The lines are a visual way of indicating this. Line graphs are frequently used when one data set represents time (since there will only be one data value for each time).  The data in global mean temperature anomalies [Excel Spreadsheet] is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This data gives the global mean temperature anomaly for every year from 1880 to 2019. Because we have a correspondence between quantitative continuous data values (year and global mean temperature anomaly), and because there is only one value for each year, this data is an ideal candidate for a line graph.    Line graph of the global mean temperature anomaly. Image description available.   Line graph of the global mean temperature anomaly fom 1880 to 2019. Data is from . Image Description .     Combining Graphs  You can show multiple data sets at the same time by combining these graphs in various ways. If the two data sets have quantitative values in the same (or similar) ranges, it may make sense to combine them into a single bar chart (with different colored\/shaded bars for each data set) or a single line graph (with a different color\/pattern for each data set).  For example, the data in total co2 emissions of the USA and China [Excel Spreadsheet] is from the World Bank. The data gives the CO2 emissions of the United States and China from 1960 to 2018 in kilotons. Because these data sets have a similar scale, we can display them on a single graph. We use a line graph because the data set is quantitative continuous and has a single value for each year.    Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and China. Image description available.   Paired line graph of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and China from 1960 to 2018 in gigatons. Data is from . Image Description .   If you have data with very different scales, though, a paired line graph is not a great choice. Consider the graph below, which shows CO2 emissions for the United States again (in gigatons) and the emissions for Singapore, a much smaller nation with much lower emissions.    Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and Singapore. Image description available.   Paired line graph of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and Singapore from 1960 to 2018 in gigatons. Data is from . Image Description .   Because Singapore's emissions are so much less than those of the United States, the graph shows them to be essentially 0 - which is not the case. We don't see anything of the pattern of how Singaporean emissions have changed over the past 60 years because the US emissions are so much larger. To show these two data sets together, it is better to graph them each individually.     Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of Singapore. Image description available.   Total CO2 emissions of Singapore from 1960 to 2018 in kilotons. Data is from . Image Description .     Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of the United States. Image description available.   Total CO2 emissions of the United States from 1960 to 2018 in kilotons. Data is from . Image Description .    Bar charts can be combined in a similar way - putting bars for two different things on the same graph if they have similar scales, or putting two bar charts side by side if they have different scales. Here's a bar chart that shows the percentage of households that own 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5+ vehicles in Great Britain and in the United States.    Bar chart of vehicle ownership in Great Britain and the United States. Image description available.   Percentage of households owning 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more vehicles in Great Britain (data from 2014-2016) and the United States (data from 2019). Data is from and . Image Description .   Looking at a paired bar graph like this can help you compare the amounts for different data sets. For example, this graph shows us that Americans tend to own more cars per households than the British, and are more likely to have a car in their household.  If we want to compare two data sets using pie charts, you can take the same approach and look at two pie charts side-by-side.     Pie chart of household vehicle access in the USA. Image description available.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in the United States, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from . Image Description .     Pie chart of household vehicle access in Great Britain. Image description available.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in Great Britain, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from . Image Description .    A more effective way to display the data from two pie charts is to combine them into a stacked bar chart. A stacked bar chart is used to compare the relative frequencies of data in two different data sets. The data can be any kind of data, but if it is quantitative continuous it will need to be divided into categories. In a stacked bar chart, each bar acts like a pie chart - with the different sections of the bars representing the percentages of the entire group. Each bar goes all the way from the bottom (0%) to the top (100%), split up into pieces which represent the percentages.    Stacked bar chart comparing vehicle ownership in the United States and Great Britain. Image Description available.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in the United States compared to Great Britain, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from and . Image Description .   Notice here that our bar chart is horizontal instead of vertical. This is entirely an aesthetic choice - we can do horizontal or vertical bars for any chart. You should do whichever looks better or fits better in your document. Here, we used horizontal bars so that we could fit the percent values on each section of the bar.    Other Ways of Visualizing Information  The internet has greatly changed the way that people visualize data. With books, magazines, and newspapers, data visualizations were restricted to static images like graphs and charts. The modern internet provides the ability to use more dynamic and interactive data visualizations. These data visualizations can be useful and help people understand data better, but they can also be overwhelming. We'll look at some examples and talk about the advantages and disadvantages of these types of data visualizations.  One example of a data visualization using the internet is a video which shows multiple different graphs. Sometimes these visualizations will just be a series of graphs like the ones we've seen before. For example, the graph in showed the relationship between the gross domestic product (GDP) and CO2 emissions per person for countries in 2018. The video in shows the same data, but for every year from 1961 to 2014. It also adds another data set - how much the temperature in that country has gone up or down from the average over 1961-2018. The temperature change is represented by the color and size of the dot.    National gross domestic product and CO2 emissions per person 1961-2014. Video by Antti Lipponen, CC-BY-2.0 . .   This graph contains a lot of information - 3 different data sets (GDP, CO2 Emissions, and temperature change) for every country for every year from 1961-2014. Looking at all of that data in a table could be overwhelming, but this visualization makes it easier to see certain patterns. We can see that in general, as time changes, the nations of the world are getting richer (the points move right), producing more CO2 (the points move up), and hotter (the points get larger and more red). We can also see that despite all these changes, inequality persists - some countries remain poor while others get even more wealthy.  In some ways, though, the visualization also hides other information. This graph uses a logarithmic scale on both axes. In a normal scale on a graph (what we call a linear scale in mathematics), when you go a unit over on the graph, you add the same amount on the scale - so you may go from 10 at one mark, to 20 at the next, to 30 at the next, adding 10 each time. In a logarithmic scale, instead of adding each time, you multiply by the same amount. For example, on this graph, the marks on the horizontal axis go from 100 to 1000, multiplying by 10, and then to 10,000, multiplying by 10 again, and then 100,000, multiplying by 10 again.  Logarithmic scales are used when we have very small numbers and very large numbers in the same graph, like we do here - some countries have much lower GDPs than others, because of global wealth inequality. The logarithmic scale conceals an increase in inequality in this graph - as the points move to the left and up, the gap between the poorest & least emitting countries and the wealthiest & most emitting countries is getting larger and larger.  Other video data visualizations use different graphing techniques. The video in , the position of the points doesn't really convey any information (it's just determined by the country's name in the English alphabet), but the size and color of the dot gives the temperature anomaly for that country in a particular month. You can see the points get larger and redder as the climate warms.    Monthly temperature anomaly for countries from 1880-2017. Video by Antti Lipponen, CC-BY-2.0 . .   The visualization in gives the viewer a very clear picture of how severe and widespread the warming has been in countries around the world. It does not, however, give a lot of data on how that warming is spread out, because the countries are arranged alphabetically. The video in shows the CO2 emissions per country for each year from 1850 to 2016, but arranged on a map of the world (unfortunately, a Mercator projection, which creates a biased map where northern countries appear much larger than those near the equator). This allows the viewer to see a different kind of pattern - the geographical relationship between countries with high CO2 emissions.    Map of the world, showing greenhouse gas emissions per person for each country. .    shows us that greenhouse gas emissions per person have grown most in large fossil fuel producing nations like the USA, Canada, and Russia, as well as smaller nations in West Asia like Oman and Saudia Arabia. It does conceeal some of the highest emitters, like Bahrain and Qatar, which can be seen in , because they are too small to show up clearly on the map.  Data visualizations on the internet can also be interactive. The Earth Sciences Communications Team at the National Aeronautics and Space Association's (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory has produced several outstanding interactive data visualizations around climate change. The Climate Time Machine allows viewers to see how the climate has changed over time in four different ways - sea ice, sea level, CO2 emissions, and temperature change. Earth Now is even more elaborate, allowing the viewer to display a wide range of global data sets on an animated globe, and to look at that data over a range of time or at a point in history.    Accessibiliity  All of these data visualizations - both the static images we saw before and the videos here - have one major flaw. These visualizations, because they convey data visually, are only accessible to people without visual impairment. People with no sight or sight which is limited in some way (like color-blindness) may be unable to use data visualizations as effectively as people without visual impairment.  Visualizations can also present challenges to other people. A fast-moving video, for example, may be difficult to follow for someone with dyslexia who needs more time to read. Someone who is hearing-impaired may need captions if there is spoken text or sounds. Translators exist for text in webpages, but the text in an image or video cannot be translated easily into another language.  When creating data visualizations, it is important to think about who will be able to use it. The more accessible you make your visualization, the more people will be able to benefit from it. Here are some tips for how to make your data visualizations accessible:   Avoid using color alone to differentiate data - and use highly contrasting colors if you do need to use color. People with color-blindness or limited vision may be able to distinguish highly contrasting colors better.  Make data available in another format. A data table - which can be read out by a screen reader - may be more useful than a graph for someone who is visually impaired.  Don't try to let the graph speak for itself - label everything clearly and in a large font. Explain what the graph shows in the accompanying text.  Choose a good title for your graph. People with reading or attention disabilities may read only the title, so make sure it conveys as much information about what the graph means as possible.  Use redundancy - for example, a particular quality may be represented by both the color and size of a dot. If someone doesn't notice or can't detect one quality, they may be able to detect the other.   One example of accessibility is the creation of data sonifications - like a visualization, but with sound. The online graphing calculator Desmos, for example, has a feature called Audio Trace which allows users to hear a graph in the graphing calculator. The sound moves across stereo speakers from left to right, and increases in pitch as the graph increases (with static added when it's negative). This allows visually-impaired people the opportunity to hear the same patterns that others can see in the graph.  A powerful climate change sonification from the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics at Stanford University is \"shown\" in . In this sonification, which starts roughly 400 years ago, the CO2 levels in the atmosphere provide the pitch for a background tone, while a strumming guitar sound gets louder and higher in pitch as temperature anomalies increase. The result is a haunting sound which becomes more and more urgent as time approaches the present - just like the climate crisis.    Climate data from the past 400 years as a single sound file. The pitch of the background tone rises as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, while the plucked sound of the guitar increases in volume and pitch as global temperatures increase.      "

  "body": " Mathematical Models   Mathematical models provide a means of capturing how a confluence of variables factor into and effect situations They can also be used to make predictions regarding what is to come. In this section we examine models that lend insight into global warming and the average global temperature predictions. We will look at the Green House Effect and explore how to predict temperature increase based on varying amounts (distributions) of certain greenhouse gasses. The main green house gasses are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Each has its own impact on temperature increase dependent on a combination of qualities including lifetime, abundance, and radiative capacity. Units and other measures are often defined to capture how a confluence of qualities effect a particular inpact. Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP) are two such examples that will also examine in this section.     The Green House Effect  The overarching idea of the Green House effect is that energy in the form of radiation enters the atmosphere (\"the green house\") and while some of the radiation escapes, a percentage of it gets trapped. This trapped radiation is trapped energy or heat which results in increasing the ambient temperature. The percentage of energy that gets trapped and the resulting temperature increase depends on the molecular make up of the atmosphere.  Green House gasses are gasses that trap energy. Some of the gasses such as water vapor ( ) are necessary for maintaining a stable temperature warm enough to supports life. However, growing amounts of other Green House gasses such as carbon dioxide ( ), nitrious oxide ( ), and methane have the effect of increasing the temperature potentially beyond livable conditions. How much energy gets trapped the depends on the molecular make up of the atmosphere.  In this section we will work through a simplified mathematical model with the goal of building intuition for how each compnent plays a role in the system.    Blackbody  When electromagnetic radiation is incident upon an object, some of the radition is absorbed while some is reflected. The specific proportions that are absorbed and radiated depend on the properties of the object and whether it is in thermodynamic equlibrium with the surrounding evironment. A blackbody is an perfect object in the sense that it abosorbs all the radiation incident upon it and emits radiation depending solely on its temperature.    There are two important properties of blackbodies that we will rely on in our modeling. One is that blackbodies are \"perfect\" emitters.  Not only is the amount of radiation emitted dependent only on temperature but also, for a fixed temperature, blackbodies emit at the maximal energy level. More specifics of this radiation are described below.  Blackbodies emit radiation isotropically, meaning the radiation is equally dispersed in all directions.      Blackbody Radiation   A blackbody in thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e with constant uniform temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation at a spectrum of wavelengths determined solely by the temperature of the body. The emission brom blackbodies is called blackbody radiation .  Blackbodies emit different amounts of energy at different wavelengths. How much radiation a blackbody emits at each wavelength is called the blackbody spectrum and is determined by Plank's law.   Below is a graph showing the blackbody spectrum. Each curve is the spectrum for blackbody at the indicated temperature. The temperatures are in Kelvin. Note that is and so for high temperatures like or the magnitude in degress Kelvin and degrees Celcius are on the order of magnitude. For reference the sun has a temperature of 5778 Kelvin      This is a graph of the blackbody spectrum depicting the amount of radiation emmitted at each wavelength for blackbodies at temperatues of 3,000 Kelvin, 4,000 Kelvin, and 5000 Kelvin. Each curve has a single peak and is skewed left. At the temerature increases, the peak of the curve shifts left, occuring at shorter wavelenghts. The wavelengths in the UV spectrum (0.01 to 0.38 ) are indicated by a vertical rectangle. The blackbody at 3000 Kelvin peaks in intensity at about 0.97 (in the near infrared). The blackbody at 4000 Kelvin peaks in intesity at about 0.725 (visible but slightly too long for red). The blackbody at 5000 Kelvin peaks in intensity at 0.58 (visible green light)   This graph depicts the blackbody spectrum showing the intensity of emission versus wavlength for blackbodies at temperatures of 3000, 4000, and 5000 Kelvin.    Very few objects are perfect blackbodies. However many are close enough in the sense that assuming blackbody radiation in calculations yeilds results that lend an accurate perspective. Of course the closer an object is to being a blackbody, the more acurate the calculations will be. For our models we will need the relationship between the amount of radiation emitted by a blackbody and its temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law gives this relationship and states that the total energy, emitted per unit area per unit time by a blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. The units are terms joules per second per square meter and are denoted . So or where with units of is the Stefan-Boltzman constant.   The radiative bodies that will play a role in our models are the Sun, Earth, and layers of the atmosphere. In our calculations we will assume that the Sun and Earth radiate as perfect blackbodies. The layers of the atmosphere are not close enough to perfect blackbodies so we will take them to be what is called graybodies .   Graybody  The term graybody refers to an imperfect blackbody in the sense that it absorbs only a propotion of the incident radiation. Graybodies can be more reflective of reality and adjusting for the lower absorption rate is a matter of scaling by what is called the emissivity.     Emissivity  The emissivity,  of a radiating object is the ratio of the amount of radiation the object emits compared to amount of radiation a blackbody at the same temperature, emits.    The emissivity is a proportion and thus dimensionless.   The emissivity ranges between which two values?  Think about the extremem cases. What is the most incident radiation an object can abosorb and what is the least as compared to that of a blackbody?  The emissivity ranges bewtween 0 and 1 inclusive.    Interpret the meaning of a radiating body with the minimal and the maximal emissivity. Why does this make sense?  What does it mean for the emmissivty ratio to be equal to 0 in terms of how much radiation it absorbs? What does it mean for the ration to be eqaul to 1 in terms of how much radiation it absorbs. What does this tell you about the type of object?  When the emissivity of a radiating body is 0, a radiating body aborbs none of the incent radiation and is thus a perfect reflector. When the emissivity is 1, a radiating body absorbs as much incedent radiation as a blackbody. Namely it aborbs all the incident radiation and is thus a perfect blackbody.   A graybody that absorbs only a proportion of incident radiation also emits a proportion of the blackbody radiation. For our models we assume the proportion absorbed is the same as the proportion emitted. This absorption\/emission propotion is exactly the emissivity of the object. So, for a graybody at temperature, , with emissivity the total energy, , emitted per unit area per unit time is .   What is the amount of radiation, , emitted by radiating bodies with minimal and maximal emissivity. Why does this make sense?  When the emissivity of a radiating body is 0, the body emits . So a body that absorbs no incident radiation also emits no radiation. When the emissivity is 1, the body emits which matches that of a     Modeling the Green House Effect   Our goal is not to create a perfect model that caputes every physical detail but rather invoke some simple mathematics so that we can view the conceptual model through an analytical lense. In the process we will introduce and engage with the mathematical thought that goes into modeling. We will work our way up step by step each time making a single generalization reflecting a bit more physical reality.  There are three major players in our series of models: our Sun, the Earth, and the Atmosphere.  The Sun radiates energy in all directions. Some of the Sun's energy is reflected by the atomosphere and the rest reaches the Earth. In our models, we will assume that the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is fixed. We will deonte this value by . However, in reality, the amount of solar energy reaching Earth is starting to increase. This increase is caused by a decrease in albedo . Albedo, denoted , is the proportion of solar energy that is reflected by the atmosphere. Melting ice caps, catalyzed by global warming, are responsible for the decrease in albedo. While we will not take the changing albedo into account, doing so could make a great extension project.  We will denote the amount of energy the Earth radiates by . For the purpose of our models we will take the Earth to be a blackbody. By the Stefan-Boltzmann law, or where is the temperature of Earth's surface.  We will be treating the atmosphere as a graybody. Initially we will take the atmosphere to be a single body. We wil denote the amount of energy that radiates out from the atmosphere as . As a graybody, and where is the temperature of the atmosphere and is the emissivity of the atmosphere. Recall that as graybody, the atmosphere also aborbs only a proportion, , of radiation incidident upon it.  One key assumption is that all compents are equilibrium.    First Model: one level of atmosphere  In this model we have our Sun, the Earth's surface, and the atmosphere. Solar energy reaches Earth's surface. The Earth radiates out engery as a blackbody. The atmosphere absorbs a proportion, , of energy radiated by the earth and also radiates out energy as a graybody.        The Sun, Earth's surface, and atmosphere all radiate out energy as well as absorb energy from the other bodies.    In the diagram above, each arrow starts at a radiating body and arrives to an absorbing body.  Let's recall our variables.   is the amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface.   is the energy radiated per unit area by Earth surface.   is the energy radiated per unit area by the atmosphere.    Both the Earth's surface and the atomosphere radiate isotropically (i.e equally in all directions). We capture this in our model by assuming half of the energy radiated by the atmosphere escapes out while half radiates back towards the earth. Since the Earth is a lower physical boundary in our model, we assume all the earth's radiation moves outwards and reaches the atmosphere. Let's include radiation labels in out diagram.            Recall that our system involving the Sun, Earth, and atmosphere is in a state of equilibrium. This means the amount of radiation absorbed by each body is equal to the amount radiation that body emits. We can write out a set of equilibrium equations.  Now let's use the Stefan-Boltzman law to write the radiation and in terms of temperature. With and the equations become What we really want to understand is how the emissivity of the atmosphere , affects the temperatures of the Earth and the atmosphere since emissivity is the link between greenhouse gasses and temperature increas. The higher the emissivity, , the more radiation our atmospher absorbs or traps. The absorption of radiation is due to molecules in the atmosphere and higher concentrations of greenhouse gasses push up .  First use the \"atmosphere\" equation to relate the termperatures of the Earth and atmosphere. Simplifying the last \"atmosphere\" equation we see that the temperature of the Earth is related to that of the atmosphere by or Now we use the \"earth\" equation to write and in terms of the know quatities,Q and , and the emissivity .  Substituting into the \"earth\" equation we have .  Solving for yields and Let's plug in the values for the constants.         Note: ( with the solar constant and albedo )  So our equations become    What happens to and as increases?  Emissivity ranges from 0 to 1. So when increases and both increase since the denominator decreases.    Based on the possible values for what are the possible temperature ranges for and ?  Emissivity ranges from 0 to 1. ranges from 127.45 to 254.9 K. When , is at its minimum of 127.45 K and when , is at its maximum of 254.9 K. ranges from 151.65 to 303.3 K.    What happens to the rate of atmospheric absorption as increases ?  It's increasing.   Currently the sufrace temerpature of the Earth is about . In Kelvin this is . If we plug this temperature into our equation above we can use our model to predict the current atmospheric emissivity.    Take the current temperature of the earth to be . What does out model predic is?  Solving for we find . So for ,     For the current Earth temperature of 288.3 K or , our model estimates as 0.947. The actual value of , accoding to , is predicted to be . In the next section you will have a chance to incorporate more details and develop a more presice model. In the meantime, while our model is somewhat off, we can still look at how a change in emissivity due to an increase in green house gasses effects the Earth's temperature.  According to if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles , it will cause the atmospheric emissivity to increase by 0.019.  Let's use our model to see the what is effect of an increase of 0.019 in emissivity (and thus in doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) on the Eath's temperature. We have two options for using our model to predict the change in temperature.  We can use the actual value of and our predicted value of 0.947 for   We can use the actual value of 0.78 for and the current temperature predicted by our model for      Use the actual value of 288.3 K for and the our model's predition of 0.947 for . If the amount of carbon in the atmosphere were to double today so that would increase by 0.019, use our model to determine the increase in the Earth's temperature. In the atmosphere's temperature.   would increase from 0.947 to 0.966 and our model predeicts that the Earth's temperature will increase from 288.3 K to 293.3 K or from to     Use the actual value of 0.78 for and the current temperature predicted by our model for . If the amount of carbon in the atmosphere were to double today, would increase from 0.019 from 0.78 to 0.80. According to our model, what is the increase in the Earth's temperature? In the atmosphere's temperature?  According to our model would increase from 248.6 K to 252.6 K or from to so would increase . would increase from   In the exercises above you determined that if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were to double, the Earth's temperature would increase or depending on if we used the actual value for earth's temperature or atmosphe's emissivity and used our model to predict the emissivity or temperature respectively.  Let's compare our results to those stated in the literature. According to , the Earth's temperature is currently 288.3 K or and the atmospheric emissivity is . If the amount of carbon dixoide in the atmosphere were to double is predicted to increase from 0.78 to 0.80 which in turn would cause the Earth's temperature to increase from 288.3 K ( ) to 289.5 K ( ).  Our model is not that far off and while our model is not precise it allows us to see and feel the effect of doubling the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, when it comes to climate change and predicting temperature increase we do want to experts to have a smaller margin of error.  Now that we have developed some analytical intuition for the greenhouse effect, we are ready for the next step. We will build on our current model, taking into accout other physical factors that will hopefully result is more presision.       Other Models and Measures   "

  "body": " Solving for Change   How can the mathematics we've learned help us to understand the issue of greenhouse gas emissions better? And how can it help us find solutions and areas to focus our energy?  We're going to use our mathematics knowledge to try to answer three questions: Who is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, what are the strategies for reducing emissions, and what are the most effective ways for us to combat climate change?    Who is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions?  The question of responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions has emerged as a major one in recent years. The Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty, and the Paris Climate Accords, in 2016, sought to set targets for individual nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These treaties approached climate change from the perspective of shared responsibility, in a historical sense. Figure shows how this responsibility for global emissions has changed over time in a stacked 100% line graph . A stacked 100% line graph is like a pie chart stretched out over time - each vertical \"slice\" of the graph represents the percentage that that region contributed to global greenhouse gas emissions in that year. You can see in the graph that at the beginning (1750), Europe contributed 100% of the recorded emissions of CO2. As time goes on, other regions, like the USA, began to contribute more, and in the 20th century emissions from other parts of the world, like China, India, and the remainder of North America, began to grow.

EU-27 contains emissions from the 27 nations of the European Union in 2021, with the United Kingdom and Russia (and other nations) in Europe (excl. EU-27). Image CC-BY 4.0 by Hannah Ritchie . Image Description .   In the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Climate Accords, one of the main points of discussion was how much each nation should be asked to cut their emissions. Major emitters today, like China and India, argued that the burden of stopping greenhouse gas emissions should fall mainly on developed nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries, because the CO2 that those nations emitted in the past has been and still is a major contributor to climate change. Those nations now enjoy a high quality of life at least in part because of the emissions which they made in the past, but many have substantially reduced their emissions already. Emissions from Europe & the United States account for 58% of total cumulative emissions since 1750, but only 30% of current emissions in 2019 .  Developed nations, on the other hand, argued that emissions reductions must be made by developing nations like China and India, because those nations account for such a large part of current emissions. While Asia accounts for 29% of historical emissions since 1750, in 2019 they accounted for 55% of current emissions, as seen in Figure . Because they account for such a large part of current emissions, substantial reductions in their emissions would make a much larger difference in future CO2 levels.

EU-27 contains emissions from the 27 nations of the European Union in 2021, with the United Kingdom and Russia (and other nations) in Europe (excl. EU-27). Image CC-BY 4.0 by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser . Image Description .   The Paris Climate Accords provided a mechanism for countries to set individual commitments to reducing emissions. These commitments are reviewed every 5 years, with the overall goal of limiting temperature rise to another . The agreement also seeks to provide funding to developing nations to help them reduce their emissions . This agreement seeks to strike a balance between the responsibility of nations who have already contributed to current greenhouse gas levels, and those nations which are contributing now.  This table contains the emissions for each region in 2019 and the population of each region in 2019 . We use data from 2019 so that we can ignore the effects of the pandemic, which caused an (unfortunately, short-term) reduction in CO2 emissions that was unequal across different regions.     Region  2019 Emissions  Population    International Transport     -    Oceania          Asia (excluding China & India)          China          India          Africa          South America          North America (excluding USA)          United States          Europe (excluding EU-27)          EU-27          Total           What does this table tell us about each region's share of emissions? Use the data in the table to answer the questions below.   Which region on this list contributed the most CO2 to the atmosphere in 2019?  Remember, in scientific notation, you compare the exponents first and then the digits.  China, with tons of CO2 in 2019, had higher emissions than any other region, because the exponent is larger than any other.    Some countries,like China, argue that their emissions are naturally higher because they have more people. Compare the United States and China - if you look instead at tons of CO2 per person, which one has higher emissions?  To find emissions per person, divide the total emissions by the population. Be careful to divide correctly with scientific notation!  In China, we have In the USA, we have The USA produces more than twice as much per person as China.   What are the factors that should be used in deciding how much each country should reduce emissions? Should the population of the country play a role in making this decision? What about the overall wealth and how developed the country is? Should larger countries, like India and China, that are still developing be allowed to reduce emissions less than well-developed regions like the USA and Europe? The effects of global warming are also unevenly distributed, with low-lying, typhoon-prone countries in Oceania and drought-prone & desertifying countries in Africa being hardest hit. These regions have lower emissions (Oceania's total is skewed up by the presence of Australia and New Zealand, both highly developed countries with higher emissions). Should they be asked to make the same sacrifices as other nations in terms of cutting emissions, when they will also need to be dealing with the other consequences of global warming? All of these are questions that mathematics can help us understand, by allowing us to compare the quantities involved, and the consequences of changing those quantities.    What are the strategies for reducing emissions?  You may have heard of the carbon footprint , a particular individual's contribution to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The idea of a carbon footprint is that each individual is responsible for their part of the greenhouse gas emission problem, and that they should do their part to help fix it. The Cool Climate Calculator from the University of California at Berkeley is one such carbon footprint calculator. The Cool Climate Calculator estimates how much carbon you personally produce, from sources such as driving, electricity, and foods you eat. It then provides suggestions for how you can reduce you carbon footprint, by doing things like driving less, carpooling, buying more efficient appliances, or becoming a vegetarian.  The idea of using carbon footprints to reduce emissions is that if everyone were aware of how much carbon they used, and made small changes, then our overall carbon use would go down. For example, livestock - animals raised for meat and other food products like milk - are estimated to make up 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions . Therefore, if everyone in the world switched to a vegan diet, those emissions would be reduced - though not eliminated, since they would be replaced by the emissions necessary to feed everyone a vegan diet instead.  Of course, getting everyone in the world to switch to a vegan diet would be very challenging. Individual actions to reduce emissions, like changing diet, buying more fuel-efficient vehicles, and switching to LED light bulbs do have an effect on overall emissions, but that effect is small. Effective climate change mitigation requires that these changes be made on a much larger scale.  The global pandemic, which shuttered businesses and reduced driving and energy use across the world, reduced carbon emissions into the atmosphere by only 5.4% . Experts estimate that we would need to reduce emissions by about 10 times that in order to keep global warming to 2 degrees Centigrade above pre-industrial levels. . If you think about how your life changed during the pandemic, imagine having to make similarly dramatic changes every year for 10 years to get a sense of how much you would need to change your life to solve this problem - and not only would you need to do it, but you would need to get everyone else to agree to do it too.  While the carbon footprint encourages individuals to make change in their own lives, other solutions focus on making broader change across entire countries or across the world. For example, another way to reduce emissions from livestock production would be to increases taxes and fees on meat production, encouraging people to eat less. The most effective ways to reduce emissions from driving - estimated to make up 25% of US emissions include requiring cars to have higher gas mileage, increasing the cost of gasoline, and developing better public transit.  By looking at the problem from a mathematical perspective, we can start to get an appreciation for the scale of the problem and which solutions will be most effective at solving it. The United Nations Environmental Programme has an interactive infographic on a Six Sector Solution for Climate Change which talks about the way that the solutions must balance individual and government action.   Which sector does the UN identify as the one where emissions can be cut the most? What are some strategies that they suggest to accomplish this?  The UN document identifies Energy as the sector where the most change can be accomplished, and suggests repealing policies which benefit the fossil fuel industry, introducing policies to support renewable energy, and reducing individual energy consumption.     Consequences of Failing to Act  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has built mathematical models - like the ones we studied in , but much more complicated - to predict how much global temperatures will rise in the future. These models are referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways (RPC), because they represent how the concentration of CO will change throughout the future . These models range from RCP2.6, in which humans manage to limit global warming to an average of 1.5 degrees Celsius, to RCP4.5 with an increase of 2.4 degrees celsius, RCP6.0 with an increase of 3 degrees, and RCP8.5, in which humans continue to increase emissions as we have been for centuries, with global warming on average of 4.9 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 (and more beyond that).  These mathematical models are built the same way that the ones in are - using the physical properties of greenhouse gases. Because they also depend upon assumptions about complicated climatological process, like the role of melting sea ice in cooling the Earth or how the warming sea levels reduce the carbon capacity of plankton in the ocean, the predicted warming can vary greatly in a particular model. The RCP8.5 model, for example, predicts global warming of 4.9 degrees by 2100, but with a margin of error around 1.3 degrees . This means that the modelers are confident (in this case, 90% confident) that the actual sea level rise in this scenario would be between and degrees Celsius. This would produce a corresponding global sea rise of 0.53 to 1.78 meters (1.74 to 5.84 feet).  This sea level rise would not be evenly distributed, because colder water is more dense than warm water. For example, water around Antarctica and Greenland would actually cool, because of the melting ice contributed by a warmer climate. Water in warmer areas would expand more. , from , gives lower, median, and upper estimates of the amount of sea level rise that different cities will experience under three scenarios - when warming is limited to 2℃, 4℃, and 5℃ by 2100.

For example, this map shows the New York City area with 2.2m of sea level rise , the upper limit of the sea level rise estimated in . You can see that large parts of the area are underwater, including Newark and LaGuardia International Airports, Coney Island, and large parts of downtown Manhattan, including the World Trade Center. The densely populated city of Guangzhou, China, would suffer even more under the worst-case scenario of 1.99 m of sea level rise .   What would London look like with the median sea level rise from 5℃ of global warming?  The median sea level rise from 5℃ of global warming is 0.78m, so we can round to 0.8m.   Putting this into the map, we get the following map of London . Substantial parts of South London would be under water, and even more of the port areas east of the city.     The article gives sea level rise figures for 136 coastal cities in Table S2. Find the median sea level rise in Miami if global warming is 5℃ by 2100. How does this compare to the median sea level rise if global warming is limited to 2℃ by 2100?  The median sea level rise with 5℃ is 0.86 m. With 2℃ it is 0.22 m.   With 0.9 m of sea level rise, substantial parts of Miami Beach and areas around the river will be flooded, as seen in this map of Miami .  With 0.2 m of sea level rise, only small coastal areas will flood, as seen in this map of Miami .    Of course, all of these sea level rise calculations only account for the level of the sea under normal conditions. Other factors, like tides and winds, especially the storm surge from hurricanes, can produce temporarily much higher sea levels. Cities like Miami already experience flooding during high tides, which can reach as high as 1.2 m above current sea level . Global warming will increase the frequency and amplitude of these high tides, making the flooding even worse.  Mathematical models can be used to estimate the storm surge from future storms. Like the rise in sea level, this is very specific to particular areas - in this case, because of the geography that causes storm surge. The shape of the sea in a particular area can increase flooding in one area and decrease it in others. A mathematical model of New York harbor in New York City predicts that storm surges from hurricanes, which currently average 2 m, could be 2.75 m on average by 2100 in the RCP4.5 (2.4 ℃ of warming) scenario or over 3 m in the RCP8.6 (5 ℃ of warming) scenario.   Use the maps to see what New York City would look like if it suffered a hurricane with a 3 m storm surge, on top of the median sea level rise from 5 ℃ of global warming.  3 m plus median sea level rise of 1.09 m is 4.09 meters above the current sea level.  4.1 meters over current sea level would inundate huge portions of the New York City area, as seen in this map of New York City . All three major airports are underwater, and entire neighborhoods - Downtown, SoHo, Long Island City, Flushing, Jersey City, Hoboken - would be damaged.     "

Extract the data needed to make informed and justified claims.    Formulate questions based on available data and assess the limitations of a given data set.    Describe fundamental processes for cleaning and analyzing textual data.    Use both qualitative and quantitative data to present stories about people harmed by legislation targeting specific identities.       Technical Process Overview  In the rest of this chapter, you will identify and analyze recent anti-trans and anti-nonbinary bills over time, focusing on their impacts, whether or not they passed, and other details that impact people's lives. In section 5.3, you will find a data set in order to import, merge, and finally clean on anti-trans legislation. Section 5.4 will have you analyze text from “template bills” and proposed state bills to understand which template bills and organizations have had the most influence on the passage of legislation. In section 5.5, you will visualize data using side-by-side and stacked barcharts from anti-trans bills to explore trends and patterns by bill type and status. [EDIT THIS WITH FINALIZED SECTIONS]. Motivating ideas from each section will summarize the coding skills you will master and how they apply to a particular aspect of anti-trans legislation. The end of each section will contain a series of exercises which apply the chapter objectives and motivating section ideas.

  "body": " Understanding the Issue   Motivating Ideas  In this section, I will...  Define key terms relating to trans legislation.  Understand past and current contexts regarding anti-trans legislation and their impact on people’s lives.  Be prepared to apply this understanding to mathematical and data analysis.      Need to add an activity or something here that helps students grapple with trauma around all that's been happening.   We begin by investigating key definitions necessary to understand transgender and nonbinary identities and how they are targeted by recent bills.   Anti-Trans Bills in the U.S. Starting 2018  Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or many other identities under the queer and trans umbrella (LGBTQ+ folks for short) have long been targeted by conservative groups in the United States. Nonetheless, the mid-2010s seemed to be a time of increasing acceptance of LGBTQ+ identities; the Time magazine article “The Transgender Tipping Point” quoted actress Laverne Cox as saying, “We are in a place now where more and more trans people want to come forward and say, ‘This is who I am’” (Katy Steinmetz 2014).   However, after the 2015 Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage, conservative groups have sought to target LGBTQ+ people through “religious freedom” laws allowing for discrimination against same-sex couples, and more recently, transgender people of all ages. Despite the recent legislative and political attacks on these groups, relatively few academic studies have been conducted on the impact of the surge of anti-trans legislation since 2019.    The following questions are about bills prohibiting various types of transition and healthcare for trans and nonbinary people in the U.S., primarily proposed and passed beginning in 2018. Think about your personal definition, then do some research online, to find definitions of the following terms. Be sure to use reputable websites: most university\/college sites (put \"site:*.edu\" at the end of your Google search), the leading professional organizations (American Medical Association, American Pediatric Association, American Psychological Association), the Genderbread Person , and (usually) the sources linked from Wikipedia are all options. In what way(s) do your personal definition(s) agree and disagree with the Internet definitions?    Gender.    Assigned sex at birth.    Gender identity.    Transgender.    Nonbinary.    Social and medical transition.    Gender-affirming healthcare.    Drag performance.     In order to better understand the impact of such legislation, we wish to gather data from various sources to analyze the growth, types, progress, and impacts of various anti-trans and nonbinary bills from 2018 to 2023. We emphasize the years since 2018 in this analysis because, in 2019, the conservative Heritage Foundation and conservative Christian Family Policy Alliance distributed a model strategy for banning gender-affirming care to state legislators at a conference ( Harvard Law Review 2021 ). In 2020, a conference attendee and South Dakota legislator published a version of the bill seeking to criminalize doctors' provision of puberty blockers and hormones to transgender patients under the age of 16. Similar bills followed the same year: in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Carolina (Bauer 2020) . Though the 2020 bills failed, the language in bills in South Carolina, South Dakota, and Arkansas in 2021 attempting to allow physicians to refuse to treat transgender children shared similar language, which originated in a Model Conscience Protection Act published by Kevin Theriot and Ken Connelly of the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom (Theriot and Connelly, n.d.) . As we will see below, more and more bills are being proposed, and more are passing, every year since.  These bills go against studies showing that transgender children between the age of 5 and 12 are able to confidently identify their own gender identity (Olson, Key, and Eaton 2015) , among other academic studies. The leading association of pediatricians in the United States recommends that youth who identify as [transgender] have access to comprehensive, gender-affirming, and developmentally appropriate health care that is provided in a safe and inclusive clinical space…[and] that pediatricians have a role in advocating for policies and laws that protect youth who identify as [transgender] from discrimination and violence (Rafferty et al. 2018) .   We briefly describe how each aspect of gender-affirming healthcare is targeted by the categories of bills used in the data analysis in the next sections. Social transition is targeted through youth athletics bills preventing young people from competing on sports teams under their identified gender. ID requirements prevent the changing of the sex listed on birth certificates, driver's licenses, and other government IDs. Public facilities laws prevent all trans people from using restrooms and other gendered public facilities that match their gender identity. Schools\/education laws vary but include laws banning teachers from using students' correct pronouns at all or without parental permission, discussing queer and trans\/nonbinary identities in the classroom, and displaying items such as pride flags supporting queer and trans identities, among others.   Drag performance laws (perhaps better categorized as gender expression laws ), a recent development as of 2023, ban drag shows or male or female impersonators in certain circumstances, such as in the presence of minors (Tennessee's Senate Bill 3) or on Sundays from 1 a.m. to 12 p.m. (Arizona's SB 1030). Laws barring municipalities from passing nondiscrimination protections , as well as religious freedom laws, legalize discrimination in certain circumstances against LGBTQ+ people, particularly by those with a strongly felt religious conviction that being LGBTQ+ is wrong. Finally, healthcare laws prevent gender-affirming care for various groups in various ways, often including bans on hormone therapy and surgery for those under 18.  In the rest of this chapter, you will gain the skills to identify and analyze recent anti-trans and anti-nonbinary bills over time, focusing on their impacts, whether or not they passed, and other details that impact people's lives.

  "body": " Visualizing the Data   Introduction to the data set and how to work with variables   Motivating Ideas  In this section I will...   Make inferences about trends based on data and graphs.  Summarize the relationships between variables.  Interpret visualizations (i.e. bar charts) based on legislative data.    A common claim in the news media, and a common feeling among trans and nonbinary folks, is that 2023 is by far the worst recent year for anti-trans legislation. How do we explore if 2023 was the year of anti-trans legislation? This question is vague - what does an answer to this question mean? How do we use this information in our advocacy? In order to conduct research, we need to drill down into more specific questions that can be answered empirically. This is an important story that needs to be documented to mitigate and eventually prevent future cases of hate. We are trying to understand broader patterns to better understand where our advocacy work may make a difference.  The targeting of the transgender community through legislation has been a significant topic in the news in 2023. We could compare the volume of news stories related to anti-trans legislation in 2023 to the volume in previous years. However, does this approach measure what we are looking for? Perhaps the same story is being repeated multiple times?  A better approach is to look at the legislation itself. We can ask a similar question about the legislation. What - if anything - was different about the volume of anti-trans legislation in 2023 from the volume in previous years? This is another question we can investigate with data in order to tell this story.  Let's take a look at the data we sourced and cleaned in the last section. Note, we include the cleaned version of the data in this section, so if you missed the prior section, or did not finish you can still explore in this section.  Note that crossing over refers to a bill being passed out of one state legislative chamber (either the State House or State Senate) and moving forward for consideration in the other chamber. Thus, a bill that has crossed over suggests majority support for the bill in at least one chamber.   Where did the data come from? Assess the trustworthiness of the data and the sources.   A variable is, roughly, a column in the dataset.  We described some of the variables that are in this dataset.  What variables would you be interested in that are missing from the data?  What questions do you have about the data set?    A quantitative variable is a variable that represents something that is inherently numerical (such as the cost of a good or service), and a categorical variable is a variable whose values represent certain categories (such as military ranks).  Which variables in the dataset are quantitative and which are categorical?  Sometimes variable values are directly observable. For example, if we wanted to make a dataset for the price of a specific product at three different stores, we can go to the stores and find those prices. Sometimes variable values are not directly observable. For example, the number of individuals in a location who have committed crimes.  A proxy variable is a directly observable variable that is used in place of variable that is not directly observable. For example, we may use the number of convicted criminals as a proxy for the number of criminals.  What research questions do you have after exploring the data set?    How to explore the data visually   We often start investigating our questions by exploring and becoming familiar with our data. One of the most powerful ways to explore data (as well as to communicate with data) is through visualization through graphs and charts.  Before proceeding, be sure to run this code cell that reads in the data file.      What are some types of graphs you have seen before? For each, what do you think that type of graph is useful for?  The data set includes the status of each bill. Review the dataset. What are the different statuses?   Let's generate a graph showing how many bills there are with each status. To generate a graph, replace the [INSERT_GRAPH_TYPE] with one of the following in the code cell below:    A bar graph: geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")     A histogram: geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)     A boxplot: geom_boxplot()     A line graph: geom_line()     A pie graph: This is the Nickelback of charts (see https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6)    A scatterplot: geom_point()      Try to create each type of graph in R. Some will cause errors - that is a sign that this type of graph isn’t appropriate for this question. Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023?    Now let us look at what is happening by year. Run the following code cell to group the data by year.   For the following two pieces of data, generate each type of graph and answer the same questions from above: Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023?    The total number of bills proposed between 2018 and 2023.     The bills signed and enacted between 2018 and 2023.          Let us look back at our work and see if we can draw some conclusions, both about data visualization and about our story regarding anti-trans legislation in 2023.  For each graph you generated, what were the variables involved? Were they quantitative or categorical? Which graphs contribute toward our understanding of our question?  Which types of graphs did you choose? Compare your choices to the variables you compared. What do you notice? Write a guideline to help select one or more graph types based on the data you are examining.  Based on what you found, write one or two sentences summarizing our findings so far regarding anti-trans legislation in 2023.     There is a difference between a count and a proportion. A count value tells you the raw number of times something occurs, whereas a proportion tells you the percentage of the total times something occurs. Whenever dealing with proportions, you have to think carefully about the denominator!   Two or more variable graphing  Both quantitative and qualitative data can be analyzed under two types, categorical and numerical. Categorical data allows us to organize the data into sections or groupings that have similar characteristics. Numerical data often allows us to draw comparisons between the data and analyze trends, relationships, outliers, and other statistical qualifiers. Within the classification of numerical data, we have more descriptive graphs that can be used (scatter plot, line graph, bar graph, etc.)  Activity Questions: Often we want to compare one variable against another to see how they might be associated. So it's worthwhile to imagine how we'd plot two variables on a single graph. Let's explore some of those graph types here.     A scatterplot: geom_point()     A stacked bar graph: CODEGOESHERE     A stacked bar graph with proportions: CODEGOESHERE     A dodge bar graph: CODEGOESHERE     A dodge bar graph with proportios: CODEGOESHERE     A boxplot: CODEGOESHERE      Try to create each type of graph in R. Some will cause errors - that is a sign that this type of graph isn’t appropriate for this question. Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023? Do these graphs prompt any new questions?   In the above activity we had bar graphs that allows us to compare the numerical data of a particular variable (total number of passed bills from 2018 to 2023) with the total number of introduced bills within this same time period or the total number of bills that crossed over again during the same time period. Using these graphs we can explore a relationship between the proportions of bills which are crossed over or passed within each year as well as the trend over time as to what proportions are crossed over or passed. These bar graphs are sometimes referred to as multigraphs .   In the above activity we created similar graphs by focusing on the frequency or count of a Bill.Type appearing, and then we'd look at the proportion of that Bill.Type compared to the total number of bills during that year. Let's explore the pros and cons of representing data in these two methods.  Try to create each type of graph in R. Some will cause errors - that is a sign that this type of graph isn’t appropriate for this question. Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023?    Can you see how this data can also be described by using a line graph? Are there any advantages or disadvantages of using one over the other?   CODEGOESHERE for proportion vs. count graph for types of anti-trans bills proposed in 2023 compared to previous years to showcase if absolute or relative frequency is best to be used in this way. Want 4 graphs, 2 graphs are rate vs count of types of bills. The second two graphs are rate vs count of passed bills.  What story is each of these graphs telling? How do they differ? How are they similar.      In the code below, you can change the variables by replacing \"INSERT_Variable\" with your variable that you want to explore.      Consider the total number of bills passed from 2018 to 2022 and the total number of bills passed in 2023.   First, create a multigraph which categorizes the Bill.Type on the x-axis and lists the totals by Status .  Then create another multigraph which categorizes Status on the x-axis and lists the totals by Bill.Type .   Which of these two graphs tells a more compelling story?  List your thoughts on how the same data presented in two different ways can seem to show different results.       How do we tell a story with the data: answering how is 2023 different from other years  We began this chapter with the question of how 2023 is different from other years in regards to anti-trans legislation. Section 2 introduced us to different visualizations that can help us explore this and evaluate this question.   Figure NUM is a line graph that plots raw numbers of bills introduced in each year from 2018-2023. We can see that the number of bills is increasing each year, but the numbers increased more quickly in 2021 and 2023 than in other years.   What feature of the line graph demonstrates this increase?  We might want to know what prompted these increases to happen, and knowing which types of bills were being proposed during those years might provide insight. Below is a line graph showing just one type of bill. By changing VARIABLE to other types (list), you can generate different graphs.       Which types of bills are increasing in prevalence? Which are decreasing?  What type(s) of bills drove the large increase in 2021? What types of bills drove the large increase in 2023?    Our analysis has so far been focused on bills that were introduced.  What do we learn from analyzing bills that have been introduced?  What do we learn from analyzing bills that have been passed?  Do we need to analyze both–do these different questions tell us different things?    Tell students how to re-run previous analyses for *passed* bills rather than *introduced* bills.  Our previous visualizations showed that 2023 did have a significant increase in the number of anti-trans bills that were both introduced and passed. In addition to the absolute frequency counts of bills that have passed, we might also be interested in the relative proportion of bills that have been passed–that is, are legislators who are targeting trans people becoming more successful in their efforts?  SOME KIND OF VISUALIZATION OF \"SUCCESS\" RATE OVER TIME GOES HERE  SUMMARIZE THE STORY HERE   What total number of anti-trans bills were proposed each year from 2018 to 2023?  What total number of anti-trans bills were passed each of these years?  What types of anti-trans bills were proposed more often in 2023 than in previous years?  What types of anti-trans bills were passed more often in 2023?     The data in 2023 stops in April 2023, does this impact our ability to answer any of these questions? How does it impact our ability to answer our questions?  In 2023, since the session is not over in many states, we run the analysis in two ways: including both bills that crossed over and bills that were signed\/enacted, and only considering bills which were signed\/enacted. What are the pros and cons of each of these decisions in studying the data?  What observations did you make about how many anti-trans bills pass than all previous years since 2018 combined (again, recall that the 2023 data in this analysis only goes through April 21, 2023).    Given our questions this means the variables and levels were are interested in are the bills passed, crossed over (hence passed by at least one chamber of the legislature and not yet dead), and\/or signed and enacted between 2021 and 2023, as well as in each year and in the years preceding 2023.  As you explored in the activity part 1, these bills only go through April 21, 2023 . To emphasize the change in the number of bills that have a chance of passing or have already been passed over time, we combine all the years 2017-2022 and compare them to 2023.  Our first visualizations give information about the count of these bills, but let us talk about the likelihood of any particular anti-trans bill to pass in 2023 compared to previous years. We saw in graph blah that there appears to be a slight increase in the proportion of bills of all types that passed in 2023 compared to 2018-22.  This final image doesn't demonstrate an obvious finding, but does motivate another question. Is the difference we are seeing between the two groups significant? What can we infer if we had more refined tools like statistical tests (chi squared, ANOVA, prop test, etc). Or we can refine our questions further, for example, what changes in voter districts, voter laws, or state congress and senate makeup has changed from 2022 to 2023?   stuffstuff   Tell a story about the data What information contributes to answering our research question? What information does not? What limitations are there when working with this data?   In section 1, you wrote ideas about research questions you wanted to explore given this data set. Using the tools we have learned in this section, which questions do you think could be explored and potentially answered? Why you think so? Which graphs would you utilize to explore the data?     Exercises   In Section 2, you learned how to read visualizations and how to modify code to create them. Using a question from exercise 1, create graphs that you feel would best help you answer your question. Explain what each graph represents, and what you are noticing in those graphs.    In Section 3, we learned how to synthesize exploratory data visualizations and tell a story with our data. Based on the graphs you created in the prior exercise, tell a story with your data. What actions do you want your data to lead to and how are you using the data to tell that story?    Now, let's put everything together and refer to the following figure and answer the following questions.      What is the name of this type of visualization?  In the year 2023, what bill type is most common?  During which year were the most Youth Athletics bills passed?  About how many bills were passed in the year 2021?  What is an alternative way to visualize this set of data?  If you grouped by “Bill Type,” how many tick marks would be on the x-axis?

  "body": "Case Study: How can we support storytelling using different data sources?  Throughout this chapter, you have explored and asked questions about a data set on anti-trans legislation in the US in recent years. This provides a broad overview of the landscape of anti-trans legislation, where it is happening, and the different aspects of civil rights that have been targeted. As we continue to grapple with what these means for us as global citizens and members of society, it’s important to know how to contribute towards the change we want to see in this realm.  An example of an anti-trans bill that was struck down after legal action and scrutiny is Tennessee’s SB-0001 from 2023. The legislators who supported the bill sought to restrict minors in Tennessee from accessing gender-affirming care. A word-chart of the bill is shown below. Much of the language that lawmakers used surrounded terms like \"minors\", \"performed\", and \"medical procedure(s)\" in reference to gender-affirming care for trans youth. The term \"violation\" was used to frame this care in opposition to the laws proposed in the bill.   A week before the law was slated to go into effect, it was struck down by a federal judge, in a case brought forth by a 15-year-old transgender girl and her family. In speaking about the effects of gender-affirming care, the girl’s mother said, \"We have a confident, happy daughter now, who is free to be herself and she is thriving\" [ . Judge Eli Richardson, in his decision on the case, repeatedly argued that \"parents have a fundamental right to direct the medical care of their children\" . This argument highlights the role of parents in seeking basic medical care for transgender youth, and it also uses a commonplace term that was never found in the bill itself: \"medical care.\" In contrast, the downstricken bill referred to medical \"procedure(s),\" a term chosen to connote experimental, invasive, and potentially harmful treatments.   Consider how else you might be able to use a wordchart like this, or how else you could visualize the distribution of words in a bill that might bring some other obscured feature to light.   What is a research question that you can answer with a wordchart alone?  How can you combine a wordchart with other data sources or visualizations when making an argument?  What is a different way you can imagine to visualize word frequency or textual features of a bill?     Next, check out the code chunk below, where we provide the code needed to create the wordchart. As you explore the code and tweak it, try out the following exercises.   Try changing the bill that is being modeled in the word chart. What changes do you see in the output?  Think of a particular bill *type* that you are interested in (like Sports Bans, or Drag Performance), and select a bill of that type. Using that bill, create the corresponding word chart. What do you notice about the words that are most frequent? How does that output compare to your expectations?  Using a word chart that you created, write a few sentences about what you noticed and what you can say about the bill itself, using evidence from your chart.    CODE CHUNK NEEDED for students to play around with word chart creation  You can analyze a bill using word barcharts and go in many different directions. Above, we showed how tracking the broader history of a bill can add context to the word barchart and aid in interpreting how different terms were used. It also alludes to the roles people can play in fighting for justice against the anti-trans movement. Even beyond the plaintiffs and the judge—the case was brought forward by civil rights organizations; the court cited medical researchers who generated robust findings to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of gender-affirming care; the residents of Tennessee spoke during legislative hearings to generate discussions that forced lawmakers to explain their reasoning, most of which was debunked during the court case.   Next, think about what type of action you can take in your own community.   How can you use tools like data visualization and text analysis to learn something about anti-trans legislation and share what you learned with other people in your life?  What are other issues you care about that you can learn more about and contribute to change using the tools from this section?     Legal case details from ACLU.

  "title": "Obtaining and Cleaning the Data",
  "body": " Obtaining and Cleaning the Data   Here, we will find reputable sources for data on anti-trans bills and get the data into a form we can analyze.   Motivating Ideas In this section, I will...  Provide reasons for why data needs to be cleaned.  Learn how to access, merge, and clean my own data sets.  Explain and execute the data cleaning process for analysis.      Importing and Merging the Data    Finding Data Online  Our first goal is to find data. Note that any data found online may change web addresses, stop updating, go offline, or become unreliable over time so downloading the dataset as a .csv (comma-separated values) or .xlsx (Microsoft Excel Open XML Format Spreadsheet) file could save you time and stress in the future. Your instructor may give you alternative sources of data if these are no longer reliable.   Go to the website tracktranslegislation.com , which in turn obtains its data from LegiScan , and browse around. What are two things that you notice about the site? Two things that surprise you? Two things that aren't on the site that you wonder about?    This data is up-to-date from 2021 through April 21, 2023. In order to track bills prior to 2021, we use data from the ACLU's Past Legislation Affecting LGBT Rights Across the Country pages for 2018, 2019, and 2020 .  Go to the ACLU \"Past Legislation Affecting LGBT Rights Across the Country 2020\" webpage and skim that page. What similarities do you notice with the data found on the Track Trans Legislation website? What differences do you notice? Click on the \"View 2019\" and \"View 2018 Session bills\" links and do the same for those years.    We'd like to get a sense of how anti-trans legislation in the U.S. changed over time, so we're going to try to merge the Track Trans Legislation (TTL) data with the ACLU data. Since the ACLU data has different bill \"Status\" categories than TTL, we'll need to figure out how to classify each ACLU bill into one of the TTL categories.  Use the Terminology page on the TTL website to answer the following question. Which of the TTL categories would you classify \"Referred to committee\" into? \"Hearing scheduled\"? \"Withdrawn\"? You may want to click on the bill numbers on the ACLU site to see how the website LegiScan, a constantly-updated bill tracker, classifies each bill.     Note that the 2020 ACLU page was last updated on March 20, 2020, since many state legislatures were suspended or closed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic; the ACLU page promised to update the tracker as major new developments occur[red] . This data has distinct variable names and organization, so we also modify the ACLU data to match the Track Trans Legislation data as closely as possible.  For example, bills that were withdrawn, not passed by the end of a given legislative session, explicitly listed as Dead , or were recommended against by a committee and did not proceed in the legislature were relabeled Dead (at least for that year). The exception is when the bill description is specifically listed as hearing scheduled , referred to committee , carried over from another year, or otherwise makes clear that the bill is still under consideration, in which case Introduced or Crossed Over (depending on whether the bill had been passed by at least one chamber) is used.  We only include bills in categories tracked by both data sources; this leaves out, for example, bills preventing localities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances within a state. We use a broad reading of the religious freedom category to include bills that allow for people with sincerely-held religious beliefs in that state to challenge nondiscrimination laws, discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, refuse to provide healthcare to LGBTQ+ people, refuse to provide adoption services to LGBTQ+ people; discriminate against married LGBTQ+ people, and receive funding for discriminatory student groups at public universities, among others.    Cleaning the Data  Cleaning is a process that involves fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. For more information, check out Tableau's Guide to Data Cleaning . After importing and merging data sets, it is integral to clean the data before working or manipulating the data and producing any conclusions. While the cleaning process can be done manually, it is much more efficient to use a software program such as Microsoft Excel or a programming language such as R when working with multiple data sets or large quantities of data.  Here are the steps to clean your data:  1. Remove duplicate or irrelevant information  2. Fix naming conventions, typos, or any other structural errors that do not make the data uniform  3. Filter unwanted data such as outliers  4. Handle missing data by dropping observations, inputting missing values, or altering the data  5. Validate and ensure that the cleaning process was completed correctly before beginning the coding or visualizing process  First, the 2018-2020 ACLU datasets code state names by their two-letter abbreviations (e.g., AZ instead of Arizona ), while Track Trans Legislation uses full names. So we use a program to convert full names to abbreviations in the whole dataset. We have done this cleaning and it can be found in ADD GITHUB LINK HERE! You can see the code we used here: ADD THE CODE FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE CURIOUS!!!! We also note that, for example, the 2021 dataset includes some bills passed in January 2022, so we eliminate duplicate bills.  This decreases the number of bills in our dataset from 927 to 893. Next, note that the bills whose status is labeled Introduced* by TTL are those that failed to meet their state's crossover deadline , the date by which a bill must pass out of the chamber in which it was introduced and to the other chamber (e.g. State House vs. Senate). According to the site Track Trans Legislation , a bill that is not passed in its initial chamber by the crossover deadline faces high procedural hurdles in order to move forward. Thus, we wish to classify these bills (at least for the current session) as Dead\/Failed .  Moreover, one bill's status is listed as Posted , Kentucky's HB132 in 2020. LegiScan research reveals that this bill died in committee, so we update its status to Dead\/Failed .  Let’s walk through cleaning the most recent anti-trans legislation data from Track Trans Legislation   1. Let’s look at the data from all states, all bill types, and all statuses (i.e. you should not be filtering anything in this case). Click on the “Export” button and download the data as a CSV file.   Data from Track Trans Legislation displaying dates, states, bills, bill types, and statuses with a red box highlighting the \"Export\" button.   2. We now need to open the CSV file in Excel. To do this, take the following steps: Open Excel. Select File → Open…→ Choose the CSV file. The Excel sheet should populate with the data.  3. To get a preview of what the data looks like, go to the Home tab within Excel and press Analyze Data. A side panel should appear on the right of the screen. Always be sure to check these insights present the information clearly.      Excel file downloaded from Track Trans Legislation displaying the \"Analyzing Data\" button and corresponding window.   4. Remove any duplicates. To remove duplicates: Data → Remove Duplicates, ensure that all columns with duplicates are checked off so they are removed.      Excel heading with the \"Data\" tab and \"Remove Duplicates\" button highlighted in a red box.   5. Now, let’s make sure the formatting is consistent. Let’s try lowercasing all of the state names. First, create a new column to the side of the states column. Next, in this new column, enter “=LOWER( )” function into the first cell. In the parentheses, write X:X, replacing the Xs with the letter of the original column and hit enter. This will populate the new column with all of the state names in lowercase letters:         Columns E and F from Excel file showing the before and after results of using the \"=LOWER()\" function   Note: If you don’t want the formulas in the resultant cells, you just want the new lowercased versions of the names as if they had been hand-typed, you can select the names, press Control-C to copy them, navigate to Paste → Paste Values, and paste them into a new column or on top of the column you had previously made. Doing this will allow you to delete the original column without affecting the new, lowercase column. We can also capitalize all letters in the cells we select by using “=UPPER( )” or use “=PROPER( )” to reset the capitalization so the first letter is the only one capitalized.      Drop down from the \"Paste\" with \"Paste Values\" highlighted in green.   6. Next, we will find entries for the state of “Oklahoma” and replace them with the state abbreviation “OK” using the Find and Replace function. To do this, the following steps apply: First, navigate to Home → Editing → Find & Select. Next, Replace → Find what: “Oklahoma” and Replace with: “OK” → Replace All. Note, the alert will notify you of how many cells were altered and you should make sure that all planned changes were made.      Excel heading with the \"Home\" tab and the \"Find & Select\" button highlighted in red boxes.       The \"Find & Replace\" pop-up window with \"Find what:\" and \"Replace with:\" dropdowns, the \"Replace All\" button, and alert message highlighted in red boxes.   7. Finally, we can use the TRIM( ) function to eliminate excessive spaces. For example, if in our data set we have “ Arizona” (note the extra space before the A) and we want “Arizona,” we first need to create a new column adjacent to the state column. Next, in this new column, enter “=TRIM( )” into the first cell. In the parentheses, write X:X, replacing the Xs with the letter of the original state column and hit enter. This will populate the new column with all of the state names without excessive spaces.  Note: The TRIM( ) function will not remove any spaces between two words in a state name (“North Carolina” to “NorthCarolina”), it will just remove excess spaces at the beginning and end of the state name.    Exercise  Instructions: Open the Oklahoma Excel file and click “view raw” to download the file.  You are part of a data-cleaning team focused on this data set. Your job is to clean the provided data set as follows: tracktranslegislation.com   Delete all conditional formatting (i.e. capitalization)  Replace all mentions of “Alabama” with “Oklahoma”  Ensure that everything is spelled correctly (use spell check)  Remove all duplicate bills  Create a new column called “Bill Description 2.” Use the TRIM() function to remove excess spaces in the “Bill Description” column.  Your boss wants a new “State2” column where all of the state names are completely capitalized (i.e. “OKLAHOMA”). Create a new “State2” column using the UPPER( ) function.    Note: If you want to know how to clean data using the R language, check out Chapter 5 on Data Structures in RCookbook.    Cleaning for Text Analysis  Text analysis is the process of using computer systems to understand human-written text for analysis purposes including analyzing legislation. Text can be analyzed from unstructured data sources such as emails, surveys, documents, and other online material to extract insights. The main feature of text analysis is training computer software to associate words with meanings, similar to how humans learn a new language through objects, actions, and emotions. Deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) are the principles of text analysis. (Source).   The goal of this section is to give foundational steps to clean a txt document in R studio and then use R studio to analyze the text using frequency analysis, bigrams, and optionally networks.  In this chapter, you will explore anti-trans legislation through text analysis. Note, this approach requires additional cleaning. This cleaning process depends on the specific bill, its formatting, and your group’s preferences. Decisions must be made about how much you want to clean the data for your specific project.  Note: whenever you download a file to open in R or R Studio, make sure to set your working directory to wherever that file is located. For example, if you have the file just on your desktop (not in any folder), entering “setwd(\"~\/Desktop\")” in the console window will set the working directory to your desktop.   Before we do any text analysis, we have to do some data cleaning. We will use an Arizona bill regarding trans legislation as an example, which can be viewed here .  After downloading the \"4-bill-test\" excel file, we can enter the following code in R:     This will install some necessary packages for cleaning and read the excel file into R. We want to look at first anti-trans bill in the excel file- an Arizona bill vetoed that addresses pronoun use in schools. Add the following code below what you already have:     This code will output the first row of text of the bills file. We will now clean this section with the following code. Run each block one at a time along with the code from above. You can enter \"ltext\" at any point to check your progress.    Removing line breaks.       Deleting punctuation.       Deleting a phrase or line.  This text tends to have a 1. and a. and (a) and (b). We already eliminated parentheses and periods, so now we are going to eliminate all single letter words and numbers. We are intentionally not removing all numbers. There are several references to K12 or under 18 so we want to maintain these. We also want to make sure that our words will be recognized as the same when we construct relationships, so we have to convert everything to lowercase.       Removing redundant spaces.       Identifying and eliminating stop words.  Stop words are common words that carry little textual meaning, so we do not need to include them in our analysis. For example, \"the\", \"are\", \"is\", etc...       After cleaning the data, a block of text remains.     In order to analyze the block of text, we need to get these words into what is called a word vector. For those unfamiliar with the idea of vectors, word vectors are a list of words, with one word on each line. If you are familiar with vectors from other math courses, the idea of a word vector is similar: it is a list of words in an array format. We can create a word vector and save it as a new csv file with the following code:     You can enter \"ltext_vec\" to view our word vector. Play with the following code to analyze your text.     We can note that the relative frequency (rflel) is the number of times a particular value for a variable has been observed in relation to the total number of values for that variable. We can also see from our top 20 list that \"school\" and \"pronoun\" were of the most common words used in the text. This makes sense given the context of this bill.        Visualizing Text Analysis Data  We can continue our investigation of the bill by creating and analyzing visualizations.    Download the atl_heritage.Rmd , 4-bill-test.xlsx , template legislation.xlsx , and Pro-LGBTQ-Bills.csv files from GitHub .  Open atl_heritage.Rmd in R Studio and run the code by selecting Run→Run All. A small yellow banner may pop up at the top of your screen that you do not have a library installed. Press “Install,” and run the code again.  Tabs named “bills,” “template_leg,” “probills,” “ltext_cuonts,” and “counts_ordered” appear in the bar next to the original .Rmd file. What information do each of these tabs contain?  After running the code, some tables and graphs will appear directly in the code. Return to the .Rmd tab and scroll through the code until you find the following table. How many times does the word “employee” appear in the bill? Hint: look at the “n” column. What is the relative frequency of the word “education”? Hint: look at the “relf” column.     Continue to scroll through the graphs. Talk with a partner about what looks nice in each graph, and what you would want to change. Which graph is your favorite? Why?      Exercises  Now, it's your turn to try!   Using the following graph, answer the questions 1-6.      What does the label “n” on the y-axis mean?  What title would you give to the graph?  How many words appear exactly 5 times in the bill?  How many words appear at least 7 times in the bill?  What word appears the most?  What might this information tell us about the bill?     List 3 things you can do to clean data learned in Section 5.4 and 3 things you can do to clean data for text analysis (discussed in this section). What are some similarities and differences between the methods you came up with?    What do you think would happen if you didn't clean the data before making a word vector? How might the graph look different?    Which cleaning method for text analysis do you think would be most useful to learn? Why? This question is asking for an opinion, there is no right answer.    "

  "title": "Mini-Project: Analyzing Legislation",
  "body": " Mini-Project: Analyzing Legislation   In a democracy, or even a state which retains enough characteristics of a democracy that there is a legislative process, social justice advocates often must monitor trends in legislation that is proposed and passed. In the U.S., the legislative branch of the government was designed by the founders to be the most powerful, having the ability to control the number of justices on the Supreme Court and confirm justices, as well as overriding vetoes and policy of the executive branch.  Access to data is itself a social justice issue. For example, researchers over the last decade have monitored public Twitter posts to analyze how people feel about various issues (a process called \"sentiment analysis\") or generally what people are talking about. Previously, access to of tweets on the platform had been free through Twitter's API, a collection of methods for accessing Twitter's data. However, in March 2023, Elon Musk and other Twitter decision-makers raised the price for access to of tweets to $42,000 a month , a cost that one researcher said no \"academic on the planet...could afford.\"  More directly related to legislative analysis, proposed legislation is usually listed on state and territorial government webpages, but one would have to visit all of these 56+ pages, find a way of downloading the data into a spreadsheet, and continually monitor each of the pages for new bills in order to keep up with proposed legislation nationwide. Websites such as LegiScan make this easier by aggregating data from all state legislatures, but in order to get this data into a form that can be imported into data analysis software, some knowledge of data scraping\/scripting is required, and for large queries, paid API access may be necessary.  For these reasons, we use data that has already been collected and cleaned by nonprofit or government sources. We have first accessed the website \"CRT Forward Tracking Project\" , which tracks bills seeking to ban or limit discussion of historical and systemic racism in the United States. This website does not provide a way of downloading its data, so we try a couple of low-effort tricks before simply copy-pasting their entire table into an Excel file. In this chapter, you've seen how one might analyze legislation affecting transgender and nonbinary rights. Now it's your turn: download this Excel file and use it to answer the following questions.    Use the CRT Forward website and other Internet sources to define any key terms (in particular, terms related to \"critical race theory\"--who defined it? What has it meant historically? How is it interpreted by progressives? Democrats? Republicans? The far-right activist Christopher Rufo?) necessary to understand the data.   "

  "title": "Research Synthesis",
  "body": " Research Synthesis  Here I review two ways in which mathematics instructors promote equality of opportunity through their teaching work: promoting the academic success of underrepresented students and encouraging students to critically analyze their sociopolitical environment with an eye toward social change. Of course, the definition of \"equality of opportunity\" is not agreed upon, but in this review it will mean a state in which that no systemic or structural bias prevents groups such as students of color, women, LGBTQ+ students, or poorer students from accessing mathematics and the jobs for which it is a gatekeeper.  There are many reasons that an equity framework is useful for teaching mathematics. There is still substantial inequality within schools, as financially under-resourced schools have fewer highly-qualified teachers, and 83% of teachers are White. Many teacher training programs provide limited education about social justice or culturally relevant pedagogy, though researchers have confirmed that culturally relevant teaching practices contribute to educational equity (McGee 2014). Preservice teachers often view student diversity as a problem rather than a resource, and many teachers hold a view that \"all students should be treated equally in the classroom\", even when this leads to disproportionately negative outcomes for students of color (Rousseau & Tate, 2003). This \"one-size-fits-all\" mentality is a common, serious obstacle to true teacher reflection and equity. Further, the \"color-blind\" mentality, in which a teacher claims \"not to see color\", leads to ignoring students’ cultural backgrounds in the classroom, thus leading to decreased student engagement, as well as a refusal to combat historical and actual racist practices (Rousseau & Tate, 2003). In classroom observations, Rousseau & Tate (2003) report several instances of students being \"allowed to fail\" through their teacher’s neglect; such students were disproportionately Black, specifically Black men.  In addition, the way mathematics is taught around the world is often indicative of a colonial, Eurocentric narrative in which Europe is a \"civilizing\" force and the significant contributions of mathematicians from non-European backgrounds are downplayed. Such mathematical leaps as written mathematical records, a place value number system, the technique of measurement, our base 10 number system, the \"Pythagorean Theorem\", and algebra all originated outside of Europe and were then used by Europeans to advance their own mathematics (Joseph, 1987). The marginalization of these contributions contributes to the perception of mathematics as independent of economics, politics, and culture; frames mathematical pursuits as confined to a select few (usually white, cisgender, heterosexual men); and enshrines deductive axiomatic logic (i.e. \"formal\" mathematical proof) as the \"only\" method of mathematical discovery (Joseph, 1987).  Teaching mathematics with an equity frame doesn’t just help fight these trends of inequity; using an equity frame that emphasizes the role of mathematics in democracy and addressing inequality results in student learning and achievement (Gutstein, 2003; Moses & Cobb, 2001; Winter, 2007). The National Survey of Student Engagement, 2004, has found that undergraduate students are often passionate about social and political issues; bringing such issues into the mathematics classroom can increase student engagement and performance (Winter, 2007).  One major way that teachers can promote equity and justice is by focusing on reaching students who are traditionally marginalized in schools. Black students are one of the largest underrepresented groups in US education, and several studies have been done to examine what pedagogical techniques promote Black students’ classroom success. Across all the studies reviewed by Johnson and Wilson (2012), it seems that providing African-American students with a common experience that grounds mathematical ideas, as well as explicitly encouraging and supporting African-American students to do more sophisticated mathematics, are important.  Another way teachers can increase their orientation toward equity issues in the classroom is through reflection. The Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics (NCTM, 1991) recommend that teacher reflection should focus on how students’ linguistic, ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds influence their learning of mathematics. Generally, student-centered educational models backed by research can provide insights about how to teach mathematics better to all students, including underrepresented groups.  Two such models were discussed in the proceedings of the Teaching Undergraduates Mathematics workshop at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (2009): Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory and covariation. APOS theory defines an \"action\" as a step-by-step transformation of a set of mathematical objects into another mathematical object; for instance, evaluating a composition of functions at the point x . In contrast, the \"process stage\" of understanding takes place when students \"internalize the action into a process\" and can then think about the process without performing it. The process stage entails a greater level of abstraction, e.g. finding a general formula for a composition of functions given data for each function in table or graph form. Covariational reasoning is defined as \"the cognitive activities involved in coordinating two varying quantities while attending to the ways in which they change in relation to each other\"; for instance, attending to parametric equations. Observations of students suggest that covariational processing involves five kinds of mental action; questioning strategies to promote each action in students are suggested (Lai, 2009).  A common problem with implementing student-centered pedagogical styles is a lack of time and institutional support. Research has indicated that a first-level teaching move to engage more with students often involves increasing pressing , or trying to help learners articulate and hence deepen their thinking; perhaps this would be a good, low-overhead way to bring more learner-centered instruction into public schools (Brodie, 2008).  The second reviewed question involved educating all students in a manner that promoted equity, justice, and a critical analysis of their sociopolitical contexts. In this direction, guidelines include: (1) working with a textbook with a strong mathematical framework and scaffolding, (2) talk to students to decide on equity\/justice issues to cover, (3) set up units around \"Essential Questions\", (4) introduce the equity\/justice issue first, (5) then begin the mathematics, devoting as much time as necessary to the concepts and scaffolding both math and equity\/justice along the way, (6) end with a great project. Some specific unit ideas: for exponents, studying compound interest and population growth; for probability, exploring the possibility that a traffic stop should be (and is) a person of color (Osler, 2007; Gutstein, 2008).  Winter (2007) provides a model of equity- and social justice-oriented pedagogy in STEM courses which introduces sociocultural phenomena through readings, videos, and activities, then assigns a problem and a structured worksheet to help students apply mathematics to the problem. Finally, students interpret their mathematical solution in the context of the original issue, often leading to discussion about the broader implications of their solution. This model has been applied to precalculus classes, teaching functions, graphing, and statistics through examining political corruption and economic development worldwide, climate change in Zimbabwe and its impact on agriculture, and water security and native peoples’ rights in Botswana, to name a few (Winter, 2007). Winter derives several principles for justice-focused education from Marilyn Frankenstein (1990), including using real situations and real information; emphasizing situations that students might have learned about through news or other media; and using controversial materials to help students increase their curiosity, understand other perspectives more accurately, solve problems more effectively, and generate creative ideas (Johnson & Johnson, 1979). Students taught using the justice approach performed statistically significantly better than a control group; they performed better on a mathematical assessment (exceeding the control group’s scores by 11.9%) and had fewer students with a grade of D or lower in the class (15.4% in the justice pedagogy condition, as opposed to 22.9% in the control group) (Winter, 2007).  There is a dearth of studies that investigate specific teaching practices which benefit underrepresented students, including teacher-student interaction and its effects. Although trying to specify \"general\" practices across a group as diverse as, for example, African-Americans in the US, may lead to essentialization and\/or a deficit framing, a variety of historical conditions in the US have meant that many students of color have been told that they are inferior academically. Therefore, such studies would benefit many groups which are systemically marginalized in US mathematics education, including women and Latin@\/e students (Jackson and Wilson, 2012). Further, although there are several collections of \"mathematics for social justice\" projects, units, and lessons targeted mostly at K-12 educators, Gutstein (2008) claims that no cogent and cohesive curriculum exists and identifies the need for one. Thankfully, Karaali and Khadjavi (2019) have provided a book of resources for postsecondary educators looking to teach math for social justice, and another volume is forthcoming (expected 2021). Further research is needed into the pedagogy and impacts of such an approach, and that such research is deeply essential, since equity-focused mathematics is good for students, underrepresented and otherwise, and good for the society in which we live.

Aslan Tutak, F., Bondy, E., & Adams, T. L. (2011). Critical pedagogy for critical mathematics education.  International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology ,  42 (1), 65–74. doi:10.1080\/0020739X.2010.510221   Critical pedagogy is pedagogy that aims to raise questions about \"the way things are\" and how things might be done differently with an eye toward equality and justice. Three domains related to critical mathematics education are surveyed: ethnomathematics, equity in mathematics education, and culturally responsive teaching. Ethnomathematics emphasizes the ways various cultures have done and do mathematics; culturally responsive teaching is defined as \"using the cultural characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of ethnically diverse students as conduits for teaching them more effectively\"; and equity in mathematics education is the creation of an educational environment in which all groups enjoy equal opportunities and equitable treatment.  Aslan Tutak, Bondy, and Adams argue that critical pedagogy has not been implemented systematically or in-depth in mathematics classrooms. The authors envision a combination of multiculturalism and equity efforts with a critical perspective, supported by education research. The authors also emphasize the importance of critical education of teachers.  Because critical pedagogy gives no specific teaching techniques or subject matter, it requires the deep commitment of the teacher or professor to the critical education process and adjustment of techniques to fit specific classrooms.     Bartell, T. G. (2013). Learning to teach mathematics for social justice: Negotiating social justice and mathematical goals.  Journal for Research in Mathematics Education ,  44 (1), 129–163.   The concept of teaching mathematics for social justice (TMSJ) is introduced as the use of mathematics both to provide students with the education necessary to succeed in the current system as well as \"to critically analyze [students'] world to ultimately promote a democratic society in which all get an opportunity to participate fully\". A growing number of researchers argue that TMSJ can support the \"ongoing struggle for equity in mathematics education\". This article presents a qualitative study of teachers in a graduate course learning to implement TMSJ. Although there are many conceptions of what \"social justice\" and \"equity\" are, the author draws her conception from Paulo Freire of an education \"not to integrate those who are marginalized into the existing society but rather to change society so that all are included\". Darling-Hammond's (2002) model of equity pedagogy includes understanding of oneself in relation to others (Self), the power structures that interact with their understanding of pedagogy (Society), the ways that culture and context affect students (Students), and how to develop classroom practices that support their students (School). It seems to me that as students grow to understand mathematics as \"useful in investigating the sociopolitical realities that shape their lives\", we will see greater engagement by underrepresented students in mathematics, so that the dual goals of TMSJ are mutually reinforcing.  Bartell argues that expanding a social justice-related math curriculum across a whole unit or year, as well as educating teachers on how to choose data, would increase the extent to which teachers achieved TMSJ goals.

Review of Educational Research , 69(1), 21–51.   Excessively competitive classroom environments have been shown to decrease the ability of underrepresented students to participate in the classroom. Several meta-analyses have shown that small-group learning and cooperation in the classroom increases achievement and productivity, self-esteem, inter-group attitudes, and attitudes toward learning, all of which benefit underrepresented students greatly and help to counter stereotype threat. Affective or humanist theorists argue that a move toward more democratic and collaborative teaching and learning processes would benefit women and underrepresented groups by giving them more opportunities to be heard. The authors’ meta-analysis showed that small-group learning benefitted student achievement significantly more for groups composed primarily of Black or Latin@\/e students ( d = 0.76 ) compared with mostly white ( d = 0.46 ) or relatively heterogeneous ( d = 0.42 ) groups. Moreover, small-group learning led to more favorable attitudes toward learning among all students, but especially among women.      Schulteis, M. S. (2013). Serving Hope: Building Service-Learning into a Non-Major Mathematics Course to Benefit the Local Community.  Primus  : Problems, Resources, and Issues in Mathematics Undergraduate Studies , 23(6), 572–584.   Service learning has been shown to provide an avenue to connect students’ learning with their lives and, in doing so, enhances both. Particularly in math courses, service learning has given students new motivation to master the course content. At Concordia University Irvine, a small liberal arts university, the required core mathematics course recommends that students tutor elementary-aged homeless students in mathematics. The university claims that the tutoring gives students an opportunity to relearn and strengthen their mastery of basic math skills. Moreover, students reflect on their experiences through written and oral work, and this gives them an increased sense of personal efficacy, awareness of the world, and awareness of their own personal values. Students also reflected on the ways that the mathematical \"life lessons\" from the Heart of Mathematics textbook by Burger and Starbird were used during the tutoring. Overall, service learning seemed to promote a greater understanding of both mathematics and the importance of service.      Hodge, L. L. (2006). An Orientation on the Mathematics Classroom that Emphasizes Power and Identity: Reflecting on Equity Research.  The Urban Review, 38(5),  373–385. doi:10.1007\/s11256-006-0041-7   This paper is focused on critiquing the notion of the neutrality of the mathematics classroom. Hodge defines diversity as cultural diversity, with \"culture\" including race, ethnicity, home life, class, gender, and the interactions between such categories. Hodge points out that racial groups are a social construct and argues against seeing racial groups as homogeneous. Hodge is oriented toward promoting equity in the mathematics classroom, especially considering mathematics as a \"gatekeeper\" for careers and life chances in general. Hodge argues that we should see the mathematics classroom as an environment for students which promotes a certain kind of thinking, one that is structured by \"relationships among qualities\" (376). Per Hodge, students possess ways of speaking, writing, dressing, and thinking determined by their culture (\"cultural capital\"), and students with cultural capital similar to that deemed \"acceptable\" or dominant in the classroom generally succeed and are rewarded. This conception of cultural capital brings into question the kinds of \"academic success\" that math teachers and professors are concerned with promoting. Hodge draws on the work of Moll (1997) to argue for the situation of mathematics education in the cultural realities of students, as well as examining what is regarded as \"legitimate\" participation in mathematics classrooms.      Treisman, U. (1992). Studying Students Studying Calculus: A Look at the Lives of Minority Mathematics Students in College.  The College Mathematics Journal, 23(5) , 362–372. doi:10.2307\/2686410   This article, adapted from a lecture by the author, discusses the author and colleagues’ experiences in trying to improve the performances (as measured by GPA and test scores) of students of color in calculus classrooms at UC-Berkeley. In the mid-1970s, when the author began his work, 60% of Black students enrolled in calculus at Berkeley received a D or F. The author’s initial conception of the reasons for this poor performance named student motivation, inadequate preparation, lack of family support, and income gaps as the culprits. Through interviews, Treisman realized the average student of color at Berkeley was highly motivated, that even students of color with high SAT scores (a measure of \"prior preparedness\") were failing, and that students of color often had very supportive parents, though often they had lower incomes. However, Treisman noticed that the difference between (primarily) Black students who were failing and the Chinese students he studied who were getting higher grades was amount of time spent working outside of class and amount of group collaboration outside of class. Treisman implemented an \"anti-remedial program\" (368) for students who saw themselves as well-prepared to provide students with a challenging, collaborative, community-based learning environment, which emphasized the importance of a great deal of out-of-class work. According to Treisman, the program resulted in Black students outperforming their white and Asian peers. This seems to support the results of studies showing that all students, especially students of color, benefit greatly from group learning (c.f. Springer, Stanne, & Donovan, 1999, above).      Gutstein, E., & Peterson, B. (2005). Introduction. In E. Gutstein & B. Peterson (Ed.),  Rethinking Mathematics: Teaching Social Justice by the Numbers . Rethinking Schools.   In this section of their book Rethinking Mathematics , Gutstein and Peterson argue that a social justice approach to mathematics benefits students by allowing them to recognize the importance of mathematics as an essential tool for understanding and potentially changing the world. Other benefits of this philosophy, according to the authors, include educating students about social issues, connecting mathematics with students’ cultural and community histories, increasing student participation in democracy, and increasing student motivation. No studies are cited to support these assertions, but anecdotal evidence is used throughout the book to justify them. The authors advise teachers to get to know their students and communities and to use the issues students bring up as springboards for math lessons. This fits with the idea, brought up in class, that students come in to a classroom with their own schemas for understanding the world, and that meeting the students where they are is the best educational philosophy. The authors point out that disadvantaged communities, those who are currently the target of outreach to improve retention and performance in math courses, are the ones whose experiences are privileged under this style of teaching, and thus that they may be more likely to learn math in a justice framework. Gutstein and Peterson argue that teaching math in a \"neutral\" way is not possible, because even trying to leave politics out of the classroom is a political decision that prevents questioning of the status quo.      Gutiérrez, M. V. (2005). ‘I Thought This U.S. Place Was Supposed to Be About Freedom’: Young Latinas Engage in Mathematics and Social Change to Save Their School. In E. Gutstein & B. Peterson (Ed.),  Rethinking Mathematics: Teaching Social Justice by the Numbers . Rethinking Schools.   This chapter of Rethinking Mathematics centers around the math-based effort of the author and a group of 5th-grade, Latina students to prevent the closure of their elementary school. The district argued that the school, Agave Elementary, was close enough to the receiving school and labeled \"underperforming\" on standardized tests, thus it should be closed. The author helped shape the students’ ideas into solvable problems. The girls analyzed test score data over time and found an increase in performance over the past few years. Moreover, the girls investigated the walk to the receiving school, measuring the amount of time it took them to walk based on a given rate. This points to a potential connection with calculus and using derivatives to measure velocity if a similar activity were done for undergraduate students. Having shown that the receiving school was too far a walk by gathering and analyzing data, the district allowed Agave to remain open. The statements of one of the girls suggest that she felt empowered and connected to the math that she used. In general, activities like this that combine math with students’ lives and with politics help support an education that engages students to become active agents for social change.      Martin, D. B. (2012).  Learning Mathematics while Black . Educational Foundations, 26, 47–66.   In this article, Martin argues that, despite a dearth of \"rigorous, explanatory research\" on Black children and mathematics, Black children and their competencies tend to be framed in ways that reinforce stereotypes of Black children as \"underperforming\" and \"mathematically illiterate\". Martin points out that historical and structural considerations affect the material and cultural circumstances of Black children, and that some policymakers and researchers ignore these forces when describing Black children in the context of \"at-risk, poverty-ridden communities, ghettos, dysfunctional families, and oppositional stances toward schooling\". Martin argues for a more robust view of the \"resilience\" of Black children in education, including the ways that Black children overcome \"ideologies of Black intellectual inferiority\". Resilience among Black students has been categorized by McGee (2009) as fragile or robust , according as students’ motivations were to disprove external racial stereotypes or to develop self-generated motivations and racial identities. Martin argues that scholars in teaching and learning ignore issues such as neoliberal education reform, structural racism, and social policy at their own detriment and to the detriment of Black children who come to be characterized as innately \"underachieving\", despite having to overcome issues such as poor teacher support, low funding for public education, school closures, lowered expectations, and others. Finally, Martin describes a study that showed how strong early educational experiences, recognition of their abilities by educators, strong support systems, and a strong positive mathematical and academic identity promoted success among Black children.      Malloy, C. E. Instructional Strategies and Dispositions of Teachers Who Help African American Students Gain Conceptual Understanding. In Martin, D. B. (Ed.),  Mathematics teaching, learning, and liberation in the lives of black children . New York: Routledge.   Malloy begins his chapter by examining a case study in which a Black student is left out of group work because he was \"not at the same level as the rest of the students in the class\"; this exemplifies how students who are not prepared well by previous coursework could be invisibilized and neglected in future courses. Studies show that Black students learn math best when they are allowed to \"focus on the whole, use improvisational intuitive thinking, recall relevant verbal ideas, engage in human and social content material, respond to extrinsic motivation, focus on interests, learn from informal class discussion, achieve interdependently, and narrate human concepts\". Thus, in order to accommodate instruction for all students, teachers must acknowledge student preferences in acquiring knowledge, develop activities that promote student-student and student-teacher interaction, value the knowledge that students bring in to the classroom, create learning opportunities in which students are interdependent, and encourage\/provide feedback to students as they learn. This process is encouraged by the culturally relevant\/responsive pedagogies of Ladson-Billings and Irvine. The primary aim of Ladson-Billings’ pedagogy is to \"assist in the development of a relevant Black personality that allows African American students to choose academic excellence yet still identify with their African and African American culture\". Irvine emphasizes that effective teachers must provide all students with high-level knowledge regardless of previous categorization. Furthermore, using a social justice frame that emphasizes the role of mathematics in democracy and addressing inequality results in student learning and achievement (Gutstein, 2003; Moses & Cobb, 2001). Malloy identifies the concern that most teachers studied did not ask students to use \"complex and non-algorithmic\" thinking, nor did they work to develop a sociopolitical or critical consciousness in their students.      McGee, E. O., & Hostetler, A. L. (2014). Historicizing Mathematics and Mathematizing Social Studies for Social Justice: A Call for Integration.  Equity & Excellence in Education , 47 (2) , 208–229.  https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10665684.2014.900428   The authors argue for greater integration of mathematics and social studies at the K-12 level in order to emphasize their intersections. The authors define social justice in U.S. education as focused on \"striving for educational excellence via the examination of social and historical issues and, therefore, giving voice to the marginalized, and recognizing inequities in order to empower marginalized and privileged students alike so that they can empower those around them to promote diversity and inclusiveness for all persons\". Studies have shown that teachers of social studies and mathematics alike focus very little on sexism and racism. In mathematics, this may stem from the myth of math’s objectivity, as instructors may consider social issues \"out of the scope\" of their classroom. However, there is still substantial inequality even within schools, as financially under-resourced schools have fewer highly-qualified teachers, and 83% of teachers are White. Many teacher training programs provide limited education about social justice or culturally relevant pedagogy, though researchers have confirmed that culturally relevant teaching practices contributes to educational equity and social justice. Bob Moses, a civil rights activist who started the Algebra Project to provide social justice-based algebra education to low-income students, argues that algebra acts as a gatekeeper to higher levels of mathematics, which disproportionately excludes students of color and poorer students. Although some criticism has held that social justice pedagogy in mathematics is under-theorized, non-rigorous, and requires highly socially conscious teachers to work, others argue that content knowledge becomes more meaningful when it is applied to social issues.      Winter, D. (2007). Infusing mathematics with culture: Teaching technical subjects for social justice.  New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 2007 (111), 97–106.  http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/tl.291   The National Survey of Student Engagement, 2004, has found that undergraduate students are often passionate about social and political issues; the author argues that bringing such issues into the mathematics classroom can increase student engagement and performance. This provides evidence against the criticism often leveled against social justice pedagogy in mathematics that it necessarily would not focus enough on mathematical proficiency. The author provides a model of social justice pedagogy in STEM courses which introduces sociocultural phenomena through readings, videos, and activities, then the students would be given a problem and a structured worksheet to apply mathematics to the problem. Finally, students interpreted their mathematical solution in the context of the original issue, often leading to discussion about the broader implications of their solution. In this study, the author applies this model to precalculus classes, teaching functions, graphing, and statistics through examining political corruption and economic development worldwide, climate change in Zimbabwe and its impact on agriculture, and water security and native peoples’ rights in Botswana, to name a few. Winter derives several principles for social justice education from Marilyn Frankenstein (1990), including using real situations and real information, emphasizing situations that students might have learned about through news or other media, and using controversial materials to help students increase their curiosity, understand other perspectives more accurately, solve problems more effectively, and generate creative ideas (Johnson and Johnson, 1979). Students taught using the social justice approach performed statistically significantly better than a control group; they performed better on a mathematical assessment (exceeding the control group’s scores by 11.9%) and had fewer students with a grade of D or lower in the class (15.4% in the social justice pedagogy condition, as opposed to 22.9% in the control group).      Jackson, K., & Wilson, J. (2012). Supporting African American Students’ Learning of Mathematics: A Problem of Practice. Urban Education, 47(2), 354–398.  http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/0042085911429083   There is a lack of studies that investigate specific teaching practices which benefit African-American students, including teacher-student interaction and its effects. Although trying to specify \"general\" practices across a group as diverse as African-Americans in the US may lead to essentialization, a variety of historical conditions in the US have meant that almost all African-Americans have been told that they are inferior academically. Therefore, the studies this article calls for would benefit any group which is systemically marginalized in US mathematics education, including women and Latin@s. Across all the studies reviewed, it seems that providing African-American students with a common experience that grounds mathematical ideas, as well as explicitly encouraging and supporting African-American students to do more sophisticated mathematics, are important. Studies that focus on \"successful\" African-American learners provide an important counternarrative but also do not explicitly state what made those learners \"successful\". The authors suggest that future studies investigate \"(a) teachers’ orientations to teaching African-American students math, (b) forms of instructional practice that support African-American students to participate in rigorous mathematical activity, and (c) African-American students’ experiences as learners of mathematics\".      Osler, J. (2007). A guide for integrating issues of social and economic justice into mathematics curriculum. Retrieved March, 26, 2008.   In contrast to the above article, a series of conjectured forms of instructional practice that would support African-American students (and all marginalized students) is given, and many of them are congruent with scientifically studied pedagogical recommendations, although few have been tested under controlled conditions. In the absence of scholarship testing specific practices, it seems the SoTL community is currently limited to such suggestions. The article suggests that, in a context of worsening oppression for low-income and people of color in the US, a failure to address social and economic justice in all areas of education is actively harmful for future generations. Drawing on ideas of Bob Moses (founder of the Algebra Project) and Paulo Freire, Osler delineates two components of \"social justice mathematics\": math literacy as a civil right\/social justice issue, and studying issues of social justice in the math classroom. Osler suggests that the use of such practices would not only give students a concrete connection to the mathematics they were learning, it would allow students to engage in higher-level mathematical thinking. Osler’s guidelines include: (1) working with a textbook with a strong mathematical framework and scaffolding, (2) talk to students to decide on social justice issues to cover, (3) set up units around \"Essential Questions\", (4) introduce the social justice issue first, (5) then begin the mathematics, devoting as much time as necessary to the concepts and scaffolding both math and social justice along the way, (6) end with a great project. Some specific unit ideas: for exponents, studying compound interest and population growth; for probability, exploring the possibility that a traffic stop should be (and is) a person of color.      Rousseau, C., & Tate, W. F. (2003). No Time like the Present: Reflecting on Equity in School Mathematics.  Theory into Practice ,  42 (3), 210–216.   The Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics (NCTM, 1991) recommend that teacher reflection should occur and focus on how students’ linguistic, ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds influence their learning of mathematics. Within the social reconstructionist tradition, teacher reflection was a political act \"that either contributes to or hinders the realization of a more just and humane society\" (Zeichner, 1996). However, preservice teachers often view student diversity as a problem rather than a resource, and many teachers hold a view that \"all students should be treated equally in the classroom\", even when this leads to disproportionately negative outcomes for students of color. The authors argue that this \"one-size-fits-all\" mentality is a common, serious obstacle to true teacher reflection and social justice. Further, the authors identify the \"color-blind\" mentality, in which a teacher claims \"not to see color\", to lead to ignoring students’ cultural backgrounds in the classroom, thus decreasing student engagement, as well as a refusal to combat historical and actual racist practices. In classroom observations, the authors report several instances of students being \"allowed to fail\" through their teacher’s neglect; such students were disproportionately Black, specifically Black men.      Anderson, R. (2007). Being a Mathematics Learner: Four Faces of Identity.  Mathematics Educator ,  17 (1), 7–14.   This paper focuses on a view of learning mathematics through \"social participation\" (Wenger, 1998) and includes not only thoughts and actions but membership in social communities. Four \"faces\" of mathematical identity are discussed using selected quotations from students attending a small, rural high school in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Identity refers to \"how we define ourselves and how others define us\". The first face of identity is engagement (direct experience of the world and active involvement with others); students made to do repetitive exercises without creating meaning on their own may not see themselves as mathematics learners. The second face is imagination, how students envision mathematics fitting in to their broader lives; teaching mathematics without contextualizing it in students’ personal worlds would lead to students developing an identity as \"not a mathematics learner\". The third face is alignment, how students align their energies within an institution in response to the imagination phase. The fourth face is nature, but scientific studies have indicated that all students have the capacity to be mathematics learners. The authors recommend that teachers allow students to generate meaning and strategies for solving problems; one starting point is using mathematical tasks that have multiple responses or one response with multiple solutions; hdold their students to high expectations; keeping students informed of institutional requirements for college and careers; and discount the nature face in favor of the others.      Joseph, G. G. (1987). Foundations of Eurocentrism in mathematics.  Race & Class ,  28 (3), 13–28.   The author argues that the way mathematics is taught around the world is indicative of a colonial, Eurocentric narrative in which Europe is seen as a \"civilizing\" force and the significant contributions of mathematicians from non-European backgrounds are downplayed. Through a historical narrative, Joseph shows that such mathematical leaps as written mathematical records, a place value number system, the technique of measurement, our base 10 number system, the \"Pythagorean Theorem\", and algebra all originated outside of Europe and were then used by Europeans to advance their own mathematics. Some of the greatest mathematicians of antiquity, such as Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, and Diophantus, developed from the intersections of Greek mathematics with Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics during the Alexandrian Empire. Arab scholars developed a rigorous, advanced geometry and algebra during what in Europe was known as the \"Dark Ages\". The marginalization of these contributions contributes to the perception of mathematics as independent of economics, politics, and culture; frames mathematical pursuits as confined to a select few (usually white men); and the enshrining of deductive axiomatic logic (i.e. \"formal\" mathematical proof) as the \"only\" method of mathematical discovery. If we as teachers acknowledge the diverse groups which contribute to mathematics and the diversity of ways of doing mathematics, we may be better able to engage students with various backgrounds and mathematical cultures.      Gutstein, E. (2008). Reinventing Freire: mathematics education for social transformation. In J. Matos, P. Valero, & Yasukawa, Keiko (Eds.),  Proceedings of the Fifth International Mathematics Education and Society Conference . Albufeira, Portugal.   The author reflects on the educational philosophy of Paulo Freire as it relates to the current state of mathematics education in the US. Freire’s emphasis on basing the content of education on \"the present, existential, concrete situation, reflecting the aspirations of the people\". Gutstein identifies Freire’s idea that \"political experiences are necessary to develop political consciousness\" as the most relevant to his current work. Gutstein argues that the modern emphasis on mathematics education in the US is largely in service of the status quo and \"profitability for the financial and corporate elite\". In contrast, Gutstein aims to politicize the mathematics he teaches in a social justice-focused school in Chicago. Although there are several collections of \"mathematics for social justice\" projects, units, and lessons, Gutstein claims that no cogent and cohesive curriculum exists and identifies the need for one. However, Gutstein identifies one \"solution\" to this problem as using rich mathematics curricula and including relevant social justice concepts that are co-created with students in response to the curriculum.      Brodie, K. (2008) Describing teacher change: interactions between teacher moves and learner contributions. In J. Matos, P. Valero, & Yasukawa, Keiko (Eds.),  Proceedings of the Fifth International Mathematics Education and Society Conference . Albufeira, Portugal.   This paper describes a case study of a motivated, mathematically knowledgeable tenth-grade teacher at a public school in Johannesburg, South Africa, made up entirely of Black students; learners are often assaulted on their way to and from school. Since recent research has shown that mathematics education reform has mitigated achievement gaps between marginalized and other learners. The learners’ mathematical knowledge was two years below grade level; this led to a lot of basic errors, defined as errors not expected at the grade level. The moves used by the teacher were recorded and divided into five categories. In the first week of study, the instructor frequently used the elicit move to get a desired response from a learner, while in the second week, the instructor worked to develop mathematical reasoning in dialogue with his students, increasing his use of the press move to ask learners to explain more of their reasoning or push for something more from them. Previous research has indicated that a first-level teaching move to engage more with students often involves increasing pressing; perhaps this would be a good, low-overhead way to bring more learner-centered instruction into public schools.      (2009). Teaching problem solving and understanding: what does the literature suggest? In Lai (Ed.),  Teaching Undergraduates Mathematics: Mathematical Sciences Research Institute May 2009 Workshop Report.  Berkeley, CA: Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.   This chapter of the workshop proceedings begins by quoting Marilyn Carlson that the debate between \"teacher-directed instruction\" and \"student-centered discovery\" is \"distract[ing] the community with false dichotomies and vague premises\", a polarizing position that may inadvertently discount quality scholarship. The authors continue by presenting two characterizations of student understanding of mathematical functions: Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory and covariation. APOS theory defines an \"action\" as a step-by-step transformation of a set of mathematical objects into another mathematical object; for instance, evaluating a composition of functions at the point x. In contrast, the \"process stage\" of understanding takes place when students \"internalize the action into a process\" and can then think about the process without performing it. The process stage entails a greater level of abstraction, e.g. finding a general formula for a composition of functions given data for each function in table or graph form. Covariational reasoning is defined as \"the cognitive activities involved in coordinating two varying quantities while attending to the ways in which they change in relation to each other\"; for instance, attending to parametric equations. Observations of students suggest that covariational processing involves five kinds of mental action; questioning strategies to promote each action in students are suggested. Finally, the authors discuss the balance of social scaffolding to keep a discussion moving and analytic scaffolding to keep a discussion mathematically productive and suggest requirements for an instructor to use analytic scaffolding successfully.
