<p>
Throughout this chapter, you have explored and asked questions about a data set on anti-trans legislation in the US in recent years. This provides a broad overview of the landscape of anti-trans legislation, where it is happening, and the different aspects of civil rights that have been targeted. As we continue to grapple with what these means for us as global citizens and members of society, it’s important to know how to contribute towards the change we want to see in this realm.
</p> 

<p>
An example of an anti-trans bill that was struck down after legal action and scrutiny is Tennessee’s SB-0001 from 2023. The legislators who supported the bill sought to restrict minors in Tennessee from accessing gender-affirming care. A word-chart of the bill is shown below. Much of the language that lawmakers used surrounded terms like "minors", "performed", and "medical procedure(s)" in reference to gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The term "violation" was used to frame this care in opposition to the laws proposed in the bill.

A week before the law was slated to go into effect, it was struck down by a federal judge, in a case brought forth 
by a 15-year-old transgender girl and her family. In speaking about the effects of gender-affirming care, the girl’s 
mother said, "We have a confident, happy daughter now, who is free to be herself and she is thriving" [<xref ref="ACLU"/>. 
Judge Eli Richardson, in his decision on the case, repeatedly argued that "parents have a fundamental right to direct 
the medical care of their children" <xref ref="court-documents"/>. This argument highlights the role of parents in seeking basic medical care 
for transgender youth, and it also uses a commonplace term that was never found in the bill itself: "medical care." 
In contrast, the downstricken bill referred to medical "procedure(s)," a term chosen to connote experimental, invasive, 
and potentially harmful treatments.

Consider how else you might be able to use a wordchart like this, or how else you could visualize the distribution of words in a bill that might bring some other obscured feature to light.
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>
What is a research question that you can answer with a wordchart alone?
</li>
<li>
How can you combine a wordchart with other data sources or visualizations when making an argument?
</li>
<li>
What is a different way you can imagine to visualize word frequency or textual features of a bill?
</li>
</ol></p>

<p>
Next, check out the code chunk below, where we provide the code needed to create the wordchart. As you explore the code and tweak it, try out the following exercises.
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>
Try changing the bill that is being modeled in the word chart. What changes do you see in the output?
</li>
<li>
Think of a particular bill *type* that you are interested in (like Sports Bans, or Drag Performance), and select a bill of that type. Using that bill, create the corresponding word chart. What do you notice about the words that are most frequent? How does that output compare to your expectations?
</li>
<li>
Using a word chart that you created, write a few sentences about what you noticed and what you can say about the bill itself, using evidence from your chart.
</li>
</ol></p>

CODE CHUNK NEEDED for students to play around with word chart creation

<p>
You can analyze a bill using word barcharts and go in many different directions. Above, we showed how tracking the broader history of a bill can add context to the word barchart and aid in interpreting how different terms were used. It also alludes to the roles people can play in fighting for justice against the anti-trans movement. Even beyond the plaintiffs and the judge—the case was brought forward by civil rights organizations; the court cited medical researchers who generated robust findings to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of gender-affirming care; the residents of Tennessee spoke during legislative hearings to generate discussions that forced lawmakers to explain their reasoning, most of which was debunked during the court case.

Next, think about what type of action you can take in your own community.
</p>

<p><ol>
<li>
How can you use tools like data visualization and text analysis to learn something about anti-trans legislation and share what you learned with other people in your life? 
</li>
<li>
What are other issues you care about that you can learn more about and contribute to change using the tools from this section?
</li>
