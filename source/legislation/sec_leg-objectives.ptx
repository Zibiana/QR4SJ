        <title>Technical Process Overview</title>

    <p>
        In the rest of this chapter, you will identify and analyze recent anti-trans and anti-nonbinary bills over time, focusing on their impacts, whether or not they passed, and other details that impact people's lives. In section 5.3, you will find a data set in order to import, merge, and finally clean on anti-trans legislation. Section 5.4 will have you analyze text from “template bills” and proposed state bills to understand which template bills and organizations have had the most influence on the passage of legislation. In section 5.5, you will visualize data using side-by-side and stacked barcharts from anti-trans bills to explore trends and patterns by bill type and status. [EDIT THIS WITH FINALIZED SECTIONS]. Motivating ideas from each section will summarize the coding skills you will master and how they apply to a particular aspect of anti-trans legislation. The end of each section will contain a series of exercises which apply the chapter objectives and motivating section ideas.
